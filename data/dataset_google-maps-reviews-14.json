  "text": "Poorly managed facility for a delicate surgery like brain surgery. The post ops. care is at 10%. About 2 experinced nurses the rest are quacks. The doctors are all inexperienced except the MD, who would prefer to hide medical complications from family of the patient. They are mostly interested in collecting your money but would not deliver even simple patient care - the nurses would not check BP but they will fabricate details of it in the patiants record. I bought BP machine with memory while they claim to be using it, their records and the machine are saying two different things. The nurses would not record high BPs in their book. Your loved one would be deteriorating under them but they are saying he is doing well. The MD is a criminal. He did not interprete all the CT he conducted until I came in contact with another consultant neuro surgeon who told me what is happening. For a procedure that we walked in for unaided. I carried my loved on like a piece of vegetable out of the place.\n\nI encountered them in 2020/2021.\n\nThe funny thing is that the MD is sending his inexperienced doctors to write and post nice reviews of the hospital. I spent over 5 months there.\nThe facility reflects the horrible state of the Nigeria health sector. The experience changed me.",

  "text": "My baby was admitted in this hospital and I was to care for her. Guess what? They didn't let me bath the first day stating they have no bathroom since she( baby) was in the ICU. The rude nurse said to me ICU bathroom is like their “official” bathroom so people are not allowed to use it. Why was she (my baby) in the ICU in the first place? Because they had no room to admit her, they asked us to stay in the ICU pending when any room will be vacant. The second day same thing until I insisted and screamed I can’t continue living there without bathing, the same nurse instructed the cleaner to fetch water in one dirty paint bucket for me to have my bath outside, what? Like some little beggar who isn't paying for it's services. That nurse obviously thinks she is working in a government owned hospital where they place their selves above patient. I Complained to admin and admin suggested I go home to bath. I had no home in abuja. Travelled many kilometres to ABJ. I was like a joke to them. If it's not an emergency with no where else to go fine (please make sure you have exhausted all your options) otherwise look elsewhere. They cost as much as other health care facilities you'll get  better care. Don’t let their structure fool you! They cost same with the big names. Also, you won't be dealing with doctors who wouldn't take your issues seriously until Google ask them to (only one experienced doctor which  is the MD, who is available during surgery, post op? You're left with doctors  who google your symptoms before they understand what you're saying). There are some nurses who are at the top of their game, that's all there is to it. If you have Refund? They would rather keep it than refund to who they had buisness with. Bunch of thives who would keep money that isn't theirs. THIEVERY HOSPITAL reason they didn't mind I pay 40k per night without providing bathroom, I don’t want to talk how they ran out of soap and couldn’t clean a messed up room. I’ll be putting up a textbook if I write my whole experience\nUnfortunately there is no zero star!!!",
