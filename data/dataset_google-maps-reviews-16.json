Vague diagnosis (\"muscle thing\") without explanation\n\nInstead of improving services and hiring qualified doctors, Abuja Clinic excels in frustration and disappointment.\n\n*Avoid this clinic* unless you want to risk your health and wallet.",

  "text": "This is hands down one of the worst medical centers I have ever had to attend. Including establishments in rural villages, emergency medical centers set up for urgent relief and other hospitals around the world.\n\nThe medical team lack basic protocols and the establishment is dirty,  it is extremely unhygienic. They will lie their way through explanations and are very reluctant to give you adequate information regarding your results and treatment. It was the hospital assigned to me with employment and I went there in an emergency.\n\nRecently I had severe diarrhea and vomiting. I went to the hospital they  ran a full bloods, urine, stool culture and urine culture. They admitted me upon entry, which I would agree was the right call- I was very dehydrated and struggling to communicate effectively. After receiving IV treatment for rehydration I was given a broad spectrum antibiotic to tackle infection after my white cell count came back high. They then told me stool culture was clear- after only eight hours, and wouldn't actually show me the results. They put me in a room full of ants, with a toilet that barely flushed and no hot water. I made the decision to tolerate it for the night as I knew I needed to rehydrate.\n\nI wanted to be discharged in the morning which caused major issues- they claimed they wanted to keep me for observation and further tests despite the fact I had not seen a physician since being admitted.\n\nMy husband explained to the nurse that I wanted to leave and emphasized the reasons why and she then went and got a senior physician. They make a bit of a drama including getting the head of admin and services down to the poor excuse for a ward. We explained our reasons very well- they admitted two other patients into the room I was in, which I thought was extremely unfair on them as I had stooled 16 times that morning and they didn't know what sort of infection I had yet. It was one badly flushing shared toilet covered in insects, I did not feel it was right for two ill women paying very expensive medical fees to have to share a bathroom with someone who could have something that was contagious.\n\nTo come on to the apparently sanitary ward the we were made to wear slippers from the hospital- which they do not wash between wears, at one point a nurse even took her own off to give my husband and genuinely did not see the problem. There are construction workers in and out of the room covered in dust and muck. When the doctor was checking my stomach he stopped to kill a mosquito on the wall. That was still there today (from two days ago). There were dead flies in the consultation room today being eaten by ants and fluids on the desk. He asked why I discharged myself (I was going back for injections) and when I said it was because I wasn't happy with the hospital conditions and hygiene he laughed at me and encouraged his colleague to join in. They do not adequately store their medicine and doctors do not conduct adequate handovers between rounds- they didn't even know which tests I had received, I had to keep telling them when they changed rounds.  We witnessed a doctor walk into what is meant to be a sterile environment in a lab coat he had walked from his transport to the hospital in. I could go on but I don't wish to sound emotional and bitter and the rest of the details are a bit grim and personal.\n\nI would not have written a review at all but after leaving the hospital this evening after going back for a final injection, we bumped into a justifiably distressed mother whose daughter had been misdiagnosed and mistreated resulting in severe consequences. When she told the doctor- he laughed.  He smiled and laughed- at a concerned mother.\n\nKnowledge shared is powerful and I am sure there are some very great staff at Abuja clinics- I feel for them because I can't see how they can flourish. However, I think when it comes to medicine people should have all the information possible to make their decision.  I have only assigned one star as it is required in order to post a review.",
