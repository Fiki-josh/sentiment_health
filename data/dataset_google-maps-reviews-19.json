From the moment I entered, I was greeted warmly by the reception staff who efficiently guided me through the check-in process. The hospital's facilities are modern, clean, and well-maintained, creating a comfortable environment.\n\nThe medical staff, from nurses to doctors, were outstanding. They were not only highly skilled and knowledgeable but also displayed genuine care and compassion throughout my treatment. They took the time to listen to my concerns, explain procedures clearly, and involve me in decisions about my care.\n\nThe treatment I received was effective, and I felt well taken care of during my entire stay. The follow-up care and instructions provided upon discharge were thorough and easy to follow.\n\nOverall, I am incredibly grateful for the exceptional care I received at Alliance Hospital. I would highly recommend this hospital to anyone seeking quality medical care in a supportive and professional environment.",

Sick patients were forced to use stairs and wheelchairs, you can just imagine the horror of going through a flight of stairs in excruciating pain.

How can that be possible?  I spent over 100k for that thyroid test and their results was even rubbish when I took it to different doctor in another hospital he was like this results is even not correct.

The nurses completely ignore you at the counter especially at the ante natal section, it takes hours to get a test result even if it's just malaria test. You can stand waiting for just a simple answer for 30 minutes from the nurses. Most times they just ignore you or give you a false information that would make you leave them alone. And guess what at my 4th visit I was told they didn't have my records. With my pregnancy I had to go to all the sections I had tests myself to get my results so the doctor can attend to me which took me three hours after waiting already for 3 hours before then just to get my turn to see the doctor at the end of the day the nurse I gave my phone to in trust and confidence stole it and the CCTV was not able to see anything in the footage. I was blamed and finally ignored.  I left there in shock because I couldn't even believe everything that had happened. I broke down afterwards due to the stress of that day as my legs were shaking from walking everywhere from 10am to 5:30pm. I heard it's because they are not well paid so they take it out on the patients. I don't know how true that is. 🙄🙄🙄🥱. That was my last day there.",
