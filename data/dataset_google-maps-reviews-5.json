  "text": "I am highly disappointed with FMC. I lost a dear friend's mother on Saturday the 21st of September 2024. I must say using inexperienced doctors at the emergency section IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. MOST  staff are so lackadaisical in their attitude. My mum's friend was dying and we are at radiology to run a scan and xray, firstly the attendant that morning (around 3am) had a REALLY NASTY ATTITUDE. Seeing that my friend's mum was vomitting and losting energy I ran back to the emergency wing to get the doctor. The nasty attendant and the radiologist said CPR  can not be performed in the xray room that there is no space for that there, we should take her back to emergency which we did (the wheel her she was on was as slow as a snail) and that is where she took her last breath. Like how can 12 people pass from 11pm to 4am and NO ONE IS ASKING QUESTIONS??????? Now the people at the morgue did ABSOLUTE RUBBISH in embalming her body because when we came to pick her she was put in a non ventilated hot 40ft container near the morgue when we asked why the bodies were not in the building where we left her with others, they said they were queried for using the building that was not commissioned......like wow!!!!! So her body had already started decaying, mind you we came on monday to move her body to Asokoro. The morticians told us that once she is embalmed that she can stay for a week without being in a cold place (freezer) smh we paid 35k for embalming and 8k cash to the morgue office, still we got rubbish service. Likeeeeeeee...............till today I'm still very disgusted by the treatment we received from FMC. FMC used to be really good but now IT IS ONE OF THE WORST IN ABUJA.",

  "text": "I payed for VIP for my wife’s delivery and this people took me through hell and back.\n\nLet’s ignore the errands I was sent like a child, and even as a vip customer and the distance between the points.\n\nFirst of all, my wife was put in a general ward that even up to 2am she couldn’t sleep because of heat and mosquito. I had left the hospital and couldn’t come back that late.\n\nSecondly, after delivery up to 24hours they did not take the child close to the mother to breast feed, and after 48hours they are coming to give false reports of jaundice, while the pediatrician check and saw it was false report.\n\nThirdly, there was no room for we that paid for vip after recovery. They still wanted to push her back into the regular hot ward, but that was were I said, I won’t allow so she was left in observation with strict instructions that she must leave after 24hours.\n\nFourthly, after making me send over 125k for just delivery items. Many of these items were not used, and they refused to receive it back and refund my balance, please which day light Robert pass this one? I will attach the pictures, you will see.\n\nFifthly, sending medical students to come and examine and use my wife to experiment,  that I paid for vip treatment?  You guys are jokers!\n\nThis whole process for me as a first timer was a very poor and appealing experience, let’s not even talk about the ability of me not being able to see my wife when I want. Or is it the other vip patient that paid for 3 days (90k) and dint have AC in her room? How do I know? She was coming to sleep in the observation ward because of the AC.\n\nNo other ward has an AC that’s working for the labour ward.\n\nMy advice for anyone hoping to goto FMC to pay for VIP, don’t waste your money. All the treatment and handling will still happen in the regular area.\n\nI hate hospitals, but FMC JABI, Abuja just collected the worst hospital award from me, if there was zero rating I will would have given them zero",

  "text": "The hospital automated process works well especially with the doctors. However, the nurses care or nurses-patients relationships seems to be absent. You don't get that touch of care after seeing a doctor. The infrastructures are okay though several construction works are still ongoing. The general parking lot needs to be more organised than it is currently. The new administrative building is impressive in size but the quality of the finishing is not so impressive (poor workmanship). The general environment is CLEAN. The court yard or garden behind the surgical ward is a serene place to meditate while waiting,  I wish they have concrete chairs in the garden.",

  "text": "So I decided to use this hospital after I stopped due to the poor service I experience years ago. As usual, I was not disappointed as nothing seem to have improved. Not only was I delayed for almost 3hours before I was told I could not have my pap smear done because it wasn't done today(only on Wednesdays and Thursdays) mind you I was not told this while I was been billed and kept waiting for almost 2hours due to the fact I made a transfer to the account that was posted which I confirm from Mary at accounts who attended to me but was too busy on her phone instead of attending to patients which she codedly came to apologize to me twice after denying the above. It is such a pity and shame that your service which you claim is to humanity has not improved even after 4 years. I stopped because I was given the wrong diagnosis twice. You can do better by employing more competent staff who are diligent in their jobs and would not lie to cover or save themselves and own it when they make a mistake",

They don't take care of your baby well, so all their test will be showing your baby is not feeling good thereby keeping him there to drain more cash on you. Worse experience ever. I discharged my baby against Dr approval and my baby has been doing just great at home. The nurse refused to give me his medical results, her reason been we discharged against Dr approval.
