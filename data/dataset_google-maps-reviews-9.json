The same nurse that did the mistake is so rude and not compassionate. They almost killed my child but God helped us. My child was on admission, with high temperature but they were giving her drugs meant for adult. The day we were to leave the hospital they refused us even when we were not owing. My husband had to do something that made them let us leave.\nPlease if you love your life and want to get good medical help, don't go to this hospital.\nI will give them 9 out of 10 for neatness because the hospital does not smell like hospital at all.

On two occasions I walked into this doctor's office and all he did was to be engrossed with using his phone and not even caring to see who has walked into his office and to know if they're in a critical condition. The same doctor when asked to explain my daughter's lab results to me, right away said that it is not his duty to do that. My husband overheard him through the phone and said hey, the doctor is a bit harsh tell him I'll like to speak to him and he also called him third party and said he doesn't talk to third parties. The summary of the whole situation here wasn't good at all. They're money hungry, very secretive about informations that concern your health( the drugs, your result and things like that) and finally some of their staff are super rude and don't care about you or what you're going through.

During my visit at 8 am with my child, we were made to wait 2 hours to see a doctor who then recommended a malaria test. The lab technician informed me to return the next day for the results for a sick child. They prioritize emergencies and seem to be the ultimate decision-makers within the hospital. If they deem your case not severe enough, you may be left waiting until the evening or the following day with no regard for patient consideration or transportation assistance. Other facilities can complete the same test in 30 minutes or less. If your situation is urgent, it's advisable to avoid this hospital and seek help elsewhere.",

For someone that is very sick you are saying I should  wait till 4pm to collect result before seeing the doctor for medication.\n\nThe worst part was when I went for scanning after waiting for my turn that was how I wasn‚Äôt attended to and they were not attending  to any patient when I confronted them the person in charge said he was busy typing , how can you be typing when I have waited over one hour just to do scan and patients are waiting that was how he started yelling at us that we cannot teach him how to do his job moreover he is supposed to be at home.\n\nI honestly have a lot to say but I hope the management gets to see this and I think they need to inculcate and teach the staff the act of empathy, because empathy is one of the core values of the hospital and they have zero empathy.",

My son was admitted within 30mins and I can tell you for free, the hospital super impressed me! The neatness of the children's ward and toilets was shocking! The cleaners clean 4 times a day! The hospital staff are so friendly and courteous...the doctors are very available...the hospital is spacious, well planned and well managed. The funny thing is, it isn't as expensive as you would normally expect a private hospital to be. A bed per day costs 3k5...the drug prices are very competitive, they even have their own security outfit complete with attractive uniforms! Have you seen their labs? Omo...madt oh! The only issues I had, there's little or no network for the POS machines in the accounts section so most times if you don't have cash or cannot do a transfer, you might end up being stranded. Then the canteen ...their white rice and stew was wack, like they used 3 weeks old oil to cook the stew. Their Afang soup on the other hand is legendary even though the quantity they serve is quite small...their kpuff kpuff is also amazing. The minimart could use a general facelift though...it holds so much potential but they sell almost nothing. If you don't buy bottled water early enough, you won't get any to buy within the hospital. Asides that and a few annoying nurses, the place is simply amazing! A plus for the bored caregivers, there are numerous beautiful spots for great selfies to be taken. Did I also mention that it is NHIS compliant ? In short, I was so impressed that I decided to move my NHIS designated hospital from nonsense General Hospital Kubwa to Daughters of Charity!üòäüòäüòä",

They take the name of St. Vincent de  Paul and are run ( I believe) by the Daughters  of Charity, but in my experience as an out-patient, this institution has little regard for their patients. They keep patients waiting for hours, after the exorbitant bills, with no doctor on seat  to attend to them. When I visited, the doctors were having a ‚Äúmeeting‚Äù for more than three hours and it appeared that as far as they are concerned, the patients could go to hell. A few of their staff were nonchalant about it. I came to the hospital in the morning and I was asked to go for a test- an expensive one at that.  And after waiting for close to four hours with NO doctor on seat, I requested for a copy of the result of the test that I paid for, so I can at least  keep it for my own records and also take it to a doctor at another hospital to review, but no, they won‚Äôt give me a copy of my own test result!  They won‚Äôt give me a copy of the result of a test  I paid for, because ‚Äúit‚Äôs hospital policy‚Äù. When I requested to speak with a supervisor or a high level manager , one of the staff told me I couldn‚Äôt. His word is final.\nThis hospital does not care if the patient has an emergency, he or she has to wait, especially when  ‚Äúthe doctors are having a meeting.‚Äù  Lots of frustrated patients raised their voices and the place got chaotic .\nThere is always room to grow in Christian charity and professionalism in this hospital.  At least with regard to the conduct of the doctor that came to deliver a cold, patronizing  message to the agitated patients to ‚Äúwait, because this meeting is for your own good‚Äù or the staff who told me that his message to me was the final word and I couldn‚Äôt seek a recourse with his boss.\nWaiting for hours here was an exercise in patience for me.\nI must say that when eventually I was attended to, the doctor on seat was kind and pleasant. In addition, I found the lady at the reception and another lady at records to be good professionals who understand customer service . Majority of the staff are great and compassionate. I understand the situation of that day was beyond their control.\nThe management needs to make sure that patients, who have paid and have been checked in, do not have to wait for hours because ‚Äúdoctors are having a meeting.‚Äù The management needs to realize that in their quest for profit, patient care shouldn‚Äôt be compromised. They also need to release the result of lab test to the patients, who request for it . It‚Äôs absurd that you won‚Äôt release a patient‚Äôs lab results to him or her. It‚Äôs the patient‚Äôs right to see and have a copy of the results he or she paid for.",
