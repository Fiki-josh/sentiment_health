  "text": "Kings Care Kubwa is now a shadow of itself. Mist of the experienced hands are gone. Apart from a few older nurses, what you have are young inexperienced nurses with killer or no supervision.\n\nThe nurses are also very poor at communicating and responding to inquiries. Because of their attitude my son had to stay an extra night in hospital because due to their lack of communication we did not know we had to transit from antibiotic injection to oral therefore breaking the treatment chain. The non medical staff can also be quite saucy. They still have a few good doctors but the establishment as a whole is no more what it used to be.\n\nI am already in the process of changing hospitals for my family.",

I was at the kubwa branch at about 7am of 23/10/2022 because of an emergency. It was my first time and I obviously didn't have a card but came prepared.\nShe asked for my card and I said i didn't have one, then she asked what I wanted her to do for me, instead of telling me the procedure.\nI asked her how much it cost and she looked at me, laughing in a disgusting manner like I could not afford it. I confronted her and she was being sarcastic. Well I ignored her and proceeded with the payment because of the emergency.",

  "text": "I was given 2 tablets of palurdrine(Malaria drug) daily from 8 Weeks of my pregnancy. The heartbeat later stopped at three months plus which I discovered in another hospital.I was attended to by doctor Patrick who said an evacuation Will be done. He collected side payment of 25k from us on the 10th of November 2018 and refused us from paying to the cashier. Another doctor who is very tall called Doctor Uzodinma did the evacuation and did it incomplete. I went to Zenith for a scan and I was told that there is remnant. We went back to kings care but doctor Patrick Asked us to go get some drugs including antibiotics and metropostol that it will flush out the remnant. We waited till the next day, remnants didn't come out. I went back at 12pm to complain but he said I should wait till the next day that the doctor who is meant to redo the evacuation is not around and that we have to buy blood the next  day. He was rude and was even walking  us out of his office with my life at stake. I decided not to continue there I called someone else who quickly reached out to unity hospital and the doctor scanned and discovered that the placenta was not removed and that alone can kill a woman in a very short time. This was how I left kingscare to do the second  evacuation in Unity. The so-called black huge Doctor Patrick just ate our money.The painful part was that him and the doctor who did the evacuation the first time  didn't even give me antibiotics to take. He used an old letter headed paper to write for us to go and buy drugs which is different from the one the hospital is currently using just so that he won't be held accountable for damages. Kingscare killed my baby with the malaria medicine and they almost took my life with their carelessness.The hospital is a no no, my enemy won't go there. Kingscare is not recommendable. Kingscare kills.It is a one star hospital .",
