You people were just pumping me with pcm injection and asking me stupid questions over and over  . How can see seven different doctors and none of them could even start me on malaria treatment after telling each of them I do not always show symptoms. You all have turned to money making machine. Thank God i discharged myself , by the time I got to the other hospital I was wheeled in , and they started treating immediately and I got better under 30mins . Please stay away from limi hospital, their doctors don’t listen (although they will act as if they are), doctors will lock themselves in and not attend to their patients because they are tired hence the long waiting line , nurses are rude(cardio care nurse ), I was told to go for emergency xray can you imagine the radiology telling me I will need to wait till Friday for the result because the doctor in charge was on leave . They will not update your chat I almost did another echo scan because the one I did was not updated , I don’t even think the doctor read it , cause I had to explain over and over to 7 different doctors.\nWell well To the people that were nice to me Dr Rotimi in gynecology(he came outside when i started shouting, took me to his office and he promised he will work on my request even tho it was not his work ), Mrs Victoria ( God bless you ma , she is not just a customer care rep she is a human and a mother ) , Dr Emeka( ‘he is light skinned almost albino’ even tho he was on night shift he stayed to attend to cause of how I was feeling), Dr David ( she was very very gentle and loving I did not catch her first name, she attended to me downstairs, beautiful ,dark and short lady).\nLeast I forget to the doctor that took my thyroid scan thank you and the male nurse in the ER the night I came ( he suggested they start me up on something, before the doctor decided to do anything, he just kept on asking me questions and I was in pain and he did not administer anything)\nOmo you people made me cry and that stupid nurse in cardio may God not bless the works of your hand , you were telling I was not patience enough, after seeing 7 doctor did all the test and the only thing you guys were giving was pcm iv upon admitting , if it was your mother or your father i hope you tell them they are not patient enough, mark my words your own too is coming . She even walked out on my husband while he was talking to her .\nYou people should sha refund me by tomorrow because God help I come there you will hear it !!!!!",

  "text": "My Family's Agonizing experience in Limi hospital.\nOn 30th March, 2024, I visited Limi hospital with my family, myself, my wife, and three children. We entered the premises at about 7:50pm to the front desk to open our cards to see a doctor. Within minutes we were cleared off to see a doctor and it took about 45 minutes to get to our turn even though there were just about 4 people before us, but there were just three doctors on duty.\nIt got to our turn and we all got in. She asked for our card numbers and attended to us listening actively to all we narrated. She checked our temperatures and my 4 year old daughter's own read above 39 degrees Celsius; mine was about 38.5°c while the other children had about 36°c.\nShe finished with us and referred us to get a Diclofenac suppository inserted in her bum because the temperature was too high for a child. I got to the pharmacy and was given the suppository which was administered to her. We were referred to get clearance for our blood test and we did. The test was said to take 30 minutes after clearance, but we waited, I slept, woke and it was over 45 minutes waiting for a 30 minutes test. Alas the result was out, but no one cared to ask if your result is ready or not.\nWe visited the doctor for the review, and she said that there was malaria present in all the tests and then referred us to the pharmacist to get our medications.\nHere the devils showed up. A bunch of humans called medical professionals with no iota on empathy for the sick. We got to their desk at about 10:30pm and we waited for a long time for drugs to be administered; they claimed to be awaiting clearance from my HMO. I asked them if I could sign off and if the clearance isn't gotten I'll pay for it. They kept mute. At about 11:30pm, I called my wife to get the kids so we returned home, no one was bothered a bit. I got to the car, called the HMO (AXA MANSARD) explained by experience to the customer personnel and told him I've been with three sick kids, eldest being 4 in the hospital for 4 hours. My son had blood mixed with his mucor, my daughter with a high temperature and I needed to pay myself if the clearance wasn't sorted.\nThen, he said that there was no clearance sent to MANSARD. I was mad; to know that we had wasted well over 1hr, and a careless pharmacist didn't care to check if the messages she sent were delivered. I returned to her to let her know that she didn't send any clearance, and she said \"let me refresh\". Refresh is what you're just doing right now. So you send a message and don't get feedback for 4, and you don't think you should've refreshed after 1hour?\nIt's sad that I'm calling out the same Limi again who almost killed one of my twins 4 years ago when they ran a rapid malaria test and said that she had slight malaria, when a week later when her temperature spiked and was rushed to another hospital where they said she had +++ malaria.\nWhy's Limi so nonchalant about human lives? And the useless MANSARD staff had to tell me that if I use my money to pay, it'll take a long paper work to refund me back. I couldn't get drugs, I could pay for it.\nWhy do you collect HMO money if you care less about them?\nThis time I'll let the world know about the death trap you run as hospital.\nI won't rest this case",

Some of them pay more attention to their phones than pay attention to the patient, quick to discharge patient for the phone especially non rush periods. The young doctor that attended to me last was on her phone when I walked in, she didn’t even bother to take vitals like BP, temperature, engage me or even check history of her patient, she just asked me two questions and sent me to pharmacy to collect drugs without telling me what my issue was. It was the pharmacist that told me what I was suffering from when I queried the medication she was giving me. I don’t think that is correct.",

They should enjoy it.\n\nBig thanks to the Doctor that saw my kids, the lady that kept giving me options and making sure I get served and the front desk staff (always great).\n\nPlease work on your pharmacy. Their attitude on the 23rd of March was poor. I got better service days earlier.",

Was feeling somehow from a monday till thursday I kept going to see the doctors to complain. In fact one doctor Onyia touched virtually every part of me in a bid to examine me. And another doctor (Dr. John) walked out on me on Wednesday when I went in the midnight at 3am with a fever. He left me there saying he had been working all night and didnt have time for a pregnant woman whom he had told to go home with a fever. On Thursday I went into labor and lost my twins after spending so much. No one should experience this. They are heartless and are after money.",

Limi is technologically compliant as Thier filing system is electronic so no paper carrying from place to place.The cost is not on the high side because once you pay to see the doctor once you are entitled to see a doctor for that same issue for a few more days.

I and other people who came to conduct business were complaining a lot , because the whole reception was so rowdy. One of the receptionist had to call a “Chisom” and ask her and her colleagues to please reduce their voices because customers were complaining.\n\nI mean. I understand that your staff work shifts but come on. The lobby was filled up and noisy. I was confused. I had to ask one of the ladies attending to me if there was a seminar before she told me some staff had closed..\n\nPlease closing time doesn’t have to be rowdy. People come into the hospital with different issues on their mind and meeting a noisy atmosphere is just wrong!!!\nI would attach pictures but there’s no coloum for that.\n\nPlease do better.",
