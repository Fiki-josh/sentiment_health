  "text": "My experience today, Sat 18th Jan 2025, left a very sour taste in my mouth. I came with my child to see a pediatrician cos he was running fever. On getting to the hospital, I was asked to make a payment at the pay-point, to see the doctor, so I made a transfer because I wasn't with my card.\n\nAfter over 1:30hr of waiting for confirmation of my payment, I was told the person or persons at the accounts don't work on weekends so they aren't picking their calls.\n\nWhy run a 24hr hospital service if you can't do the most common thing of confirming payments? Why not provide alternative ways of confirming payments since the people who are to do that don't work on weekends?\n\nAfter over 1:30hrs, I was able to see the doctor, she recommended some tests and I took my son  to the lab. Again, I needed to make payment for the test. After taking samples, I had to wait extra 35 minutes before they could process the samples because the payment needed to reflect on his card and the guy at the pay point was waiting for the people at the accounts that don't work on weekends to confirm payment.\n\nThe level of incompetence at the pediatric clinic is alarming! I am not coming back here!",

You have only one staff per desk attending to all patients and they are all acting confused especially the front desk staff. I have been here for over 3 hours today, the drama is unbelievable.

Wasn‚Äôt that suppose to be the first thing? But I never doubted their process.\nTo my utmost dismay and chagrin, after the scan and pcv, I was asked to go and come back when my pregnancy gets to 12 weeks (to them that‚Äôs when pregnancy is said to be fully established & safe beyond miscarriage).\nMogbe! So why did you let me pay for antenatal? They said they were wondering who asked me to pay. That I was to see the Dr before making payment. How was I to know?\nI went back to the receptionist and all he told me was ‚ÄúI am so sorry. God will make it stay. Nothing will happen‚Äù. Hmmmm!\nThat‚Äôs how I left to go and pray for nothing to happen. Unfortunately I lost the baby, then the drama started when I went to ask for a refund.\nFrom going round accounting blocks because every room we went said they stopped handling that (dunno what they meant). After filling the form was asked to leave, that I‚Äôll get a feedback.\nAfter weeks of back and forths, I finally got a refund after they deducted money for O & G consultation/ lab test.\nSo I just walked into Nisa to waste money and watch myself miscarry.\nA simple ‚Äúwe only register 12 weeks pregnancies for antenatal‚Äù would have helped. It was just a confused system.",

It's not done anywhere in the world that you're given a bill to pay without being given a breakdown of the services you accessed. And then a very rude and crude Nurse James and the very rude front desk officer as well. How can medications that you didn't use and don't intend going home with still be billed to you? And when they were asked to take it out, they said 'medications already dispensed cannot be returened' where on earth is that done? This is broad daylight robbery and is highly disappointing for a hospital of your standard. Make provision for the patient to have access to their bill regardless of the day or time as this will enhance transparency. We shouldn't have to wait till when the 'billers' are available before we can get a comprehensive statement of our hospital bills please. And please, teach nurse James how be more professional and nice and more diplomatic when attending to patients.

They kept us waiting till around 2pm to see the doctor whom prescribed tests and scans to be done. After the tests and scans I asked for the results which they said will be available before her next appointment and we can pick up then.\nOn the day of the said appointment I called to reconfirm and let them know that we are coming, only for them to tell me that they have removed her from the appointment list. I insisted to speak with one of their managers, he said he will rectify and call me back. Hours later when I didn't hear from him, I called back to reconfirm, only for this rude manager to tell me that \"doctor is busy, but if you insist on seeing him today you can come and beg the nurses maybe they will allow you see him\".\nNaturally I got angry that after all we have paid and gone through, a Manager will tell us to come and beg to see a doctor, as if the service was free.\nSo I went down to the hospital and demanded to get the test results printed so that I could take my wife to see a doctor elsewhere. The manager, nurses, front desk, all ganged up on me and refused to give the test results that I paid for with my own money. Test results worth almost 100,000 naira. As I write this feedback, they are still holding my wife's test results. We had to go to a different hospital and start the consultation process all over again. If this is not fraud and straight up corporate theft then I don't know what is.\nMy advice to all: IF YOU RESPECT AND VALUE YOURSELF AS A PERSON, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME GOING TO NISA HOSPITAL. It honestly is not worth your time, money and self respect.",

  "text": "\"I had a really terrible experience with this hospital, and it's gonna be hard to forget. During my antenatal visit to the hospital in the middle of January this year, the doctor had told me she was gonna refer me to the gynaecologist since my due date was near and there was no sign labour was gonna come naturally. So I was booked. That same day, I complained to the doc about my older child and I having cough, catarrh and sore throat and she recommended some meds. (This had been my complaint since I approached 3rd trimester).\n\nI met with the gynaecologist who also confirmed what the doc said and asked me to come for induction the following week (my exact EDD). I spoke to a private midwife and she advised me to buy some time, that labour may come naturally since baby and I were confirmed healthy. So I did, and met with one Dr. Abalaka, a gentleman, who gave me few more days to meet with him before finalizing the induction.\n\nWell, before the date of the appointment with Dr. Abalaka of Nisa Premier hospital, I fell into labour on 20th of January 2021. Everything was going on well until I began to cough as soon as I was delivered on the 21st of January. My newborn was also coughing because he had swallowed something. The doc approached me and asked what was wrong with me, told him I had cough and a dry throat. He then called a smallish Asian lady in to check my newborn but she refused to touch him. I noticed the medical personnels around me quietly dispersed and a pregnant patient who was brought in was quickly moved out. The only care that was given to my child was his clothes that were put on. He was denied the right medical care and attention.\n\nMeanwhile my husband and older baby were asked to go wait for me in an isolated ward. The doc approached me and said I was gonna be discharged asap because I had symptoms of covid-19 and needed to go do a test and return after 2 weeks with the results. He also advised me to return to the hospital if I had any complaints within these weeks. We were later discharged that night, with a paper asking us to come the next day to see a paediatrician because my husband and I had let one of the nurses know there were some abnormalities we noticed in our baby.\n\nWhen I got home I realized my baby had not been given his first shot (immunization) too, so I decided to seek help on the Nisa Premier pregnancy WhatsApp group, where a few mothers informed me that he was supposed to be given before we were discharged, but the group admin removed me from the group after I talked about the ill treatment shown to me at the hospital. So I headed to the hospital the next day, 22nd January 2021.\n\nI met this rude, ill mannered paediatrician named Tunde, who asked me to leave his office, and ordered the place to be cleaned immediately. During the consultation with him, he had called the skinny Asian doc on the phone, and told her \"the lady that was suspected to have covid-19\" was at his office and wanted her child immunized. The skinny lady had asked him to ask me to leave and not touch my child. I heard every word she told him.\n\nHe then told me I had covid-19 and I was unreasonable to have been there as I was exposing him and others in the building. He asked me to leave his office and not come back until I was tested. In his words, I WONT TOUCH YOUR BABY, SO YOU CAME HERE TO EXPOSE ALL OF US TO THE DISEASE! Believe me I broke down In tears because it was barely 24 hours that I had been delivered of my baby, and I was shown so much hate, degradation, discrimination and abuse because I was suspected to have Covid-19.\n\nI even went as far as asking him to check my history as the cold had been there for months and I always complained whenever I was there for an antenatal visit, but he chose to treat me like the plague itself, and my child was never checked. I am still hurt, disappointed and full of regrets.\"\n\nThat was my wife's review on their official page.I was there. Terrible experience.The neonatal doctor we saw is a terrible human. No single drop of concern for a new born baby.Wonder how he became a doctor",

Their anti natal service is not well structured. I was using my HMO with another hospital before now, and the services were top-notch.

Toilet in their area is so dirty and no water to drink. These same services are in the other areas where patients pay. NYSC doctors are assigned to NHIS patients; even children see non-paediatric doctors; test results take 2 hours even malaria test; drugs are the least in the range. NHIS patients are not valued here but if you are paying cash then you are king. Services are expensive and maybe the reason why cash paying patients are given preference.\nOn the good side, they are expanding and growing in services offered including eye and dental services. However, they are not affordable. If an NHIS patient for e.g. has an eye issue, they will be referred outside instead of the eye facility within.",

The customer service department staff also did rounds twice during my stay to ask if I had complaints and made sure that I got tissue twice.  One major concern is that the sockets in the wards are almost all dead or broken if you find a good one and I complained twice but it was never fixed.  The doctors did rounds twice daily and I found them to be nice and explained very carefully to the patients where necessary.  Electricity was 100 % OK as the hospital uses a  standby generator so we never had a blackout. The restaurant was a little off their game as sometimes the food is served late without apologies.  I was once served sour moi moi which I had waited for for over an hour and when I complained the boy who brought it said that he didn't taste the food. It is a good hospital generally, in fact it's one of the best and I would recommend it. The pictures are from the general ward.",
