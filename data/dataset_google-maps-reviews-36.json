I cried out of frustration with how sick I was feeling and the lack of care I was receiving after paying 10,000 for registration but I was instead told “sorry but it doesn’t mean you should cry”. It was truly a very bitter experience, being very sick and uneasy I had to leave the hospital after going to the lab and still experiencing same non chalant attitude. Not to mention the consultation took forever I explain tire. I do not recommend this hospital to anyone worst part was seeing thier motto “caring for life” everywhere I turned but clearly they could care less. Actions truly speaks louder than words.

Changing the prescription of the doctor without her consent and not even according me the professional explanation to why.\n2. Telling me they have other clients to attend to whose situation were presumed high priority than mine in my deteriorating state.\n3. Laughing behind my back and calling me ignorant like I was mad. After making me wait for house.\n4. Watch me leave in anger and. Poor health and did nothing to change the situation.\nI know of people who have lost family members there but I still choose them thinking they will never neglect patients. When I first started with them the priority they placed on me was top notch but I can now clearly see. How they neglect people and doctors directives.\nWo unto you, people deserve better.\nDo better!",

From my experience, he doesn't care so much about the well being of the  customer. It's not just about sitting behind the computer and submitting documents. Empathy, Care and Compassion are crucial when it comes to a health care center like yours.
