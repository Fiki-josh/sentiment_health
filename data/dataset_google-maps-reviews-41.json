A big thumbs up to Dr Amina consultant pediatrician so experienced and kind to patients and family . However I will give a big thumbs down to the laboratory services they are rude and unprofessional. Imagine a front desk officer( Emem) at the laboratory making personal phone calls on speaker while on duty and keeping patients waiting and wasting your precious time. Please remember you are offering a service and it should be top notch else what's the difference between your hospital and a government owned facility?",

Be very careful and ask lots of questions if you insist on using the hospital.\n\nThey also prey on people’s desperation during health emergencies.m to export unnecessary money from unsuspecting victims.

Took my son to the hospital, well will say the receptionist was nice, saw a doctor in the paediatric department who took her time to examine the child and sent us for lab investigation but when the results were out, the doctor had closed that was past 8 pm, we were told to go to GOPD , and that's where everything changed....I waited for them to get the child's folder which took a lot of time...said they were trying to locate it...then while waiting for the doctor my son started vomiting then stooled on himself , very weak...with d help of some amiable staff was able to clean him up....then continue to wait for the \" larger than life\" doctor who was so full of himself..Well after he finished wasting time and walking aimlessly around..he called us in...Well he didn't even look at d baby, he just told us the result of d test and said we will be admitted...I asked him if that was d only option available he said well you could go home with some oral medication ..But the child was vomiting so it could be difficult . I requested if he could atleast give some Intra muscular injections start so we could continue...he refused saying the drugs he is prescribing does not have IM alternative...all with attitude. In summary , the prescription was grossly inadequate...even the nurse that gave injection was surprised the doctor didn't see the child was dehydrated and no ORS was prescribed she wanted to take us back to the doctor but we have had enough ...the pharmacist had to go back to him to change the antimalarial drug cos the child just finished the same drugs 2weeks ago but still had 2+ of mp which I told the attending doctor during consultation.  I left the hospital and stopped at a pharmacy to buy the appropriate drugs....this is my first time of using Zankli and I was dissappointed , people like Dr. Okafor are the people that give hospitals and the profession bad name. I am a doctor, wanted a  second unbiased opinion so didn't disclose that but what I saw left me wondering ...was really disappointed.",
