  "text": "The hospital has really detoriated in terms of the quality of Staff, although the facility has remained the same over the years. I have been a client for 13 years and i have never seen this type of attitude from a doctor over the years, maybe from the receptionists but never from a doctor, the female doctor on duty 4am on the 22nd of dec. 2024 could have done better, A doctor should have better communication skills, and if a doctor is tired of the job, it's best to leave. Dr Shettima pls look into this because you are the best paediatrician in Abuja.",

It definitely doesn’t act like a children’s hospital because the doctors will tell you they aren’t pediatricians and will suggest you go to see a pediatrician. Honestly by far, the worse hospital yet.",

How can ne be coming here for health care and leaving with extra malaria.\nSecondly, the hygienic condition of the hospital is beyond extreme.\nWow! the toilets smell right from the reception and is worst in the general wards.\nThe surfaces are dirty and cobwebs can be found in the toilets. the window nets are torn and the window blinds are completely worn out.\nThird, you can hardly find staff on their seats, you have to wait for them to be located by their colleagues before you are attended to. This isn't a one day experience but a usual occurrence.\nOverall, i rate this hospital one star because there isn't a difference between it an a General hospital.",
