(God bless them).They even pray for the babies too and give words of encouragement to the mothers.\n\nI hope this gets to someone that needs it.\nYou will be fine, your baby will be fine……..",

Regular fumigation can help. More so, there's no reserved area for caregivers to pass the night. At the emergencies, there's often delay in attending to patients and often times there are limited bedspaces for instant admissions. Cost of laboratory inquiries are also a bit expensive. Expert health care service providers anyways. To conclude this, the mosquitoes here, especially at night time are more than those in all the rural areas of the FCT combined. Great hospitality can be achieved here if the government would fund the hospital better. As I write this review, I'm currently here at the Hospital. This is 1.30Hrs. I can't sleep. The mosquitoes!
