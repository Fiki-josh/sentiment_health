I think that‚Äôs his name.\nMy daughter was admitted post surgery and the next day was sleeping while we were waiting to be discharged. This Doctor comes into the ward to do a procedure for a pregnant woman. While that is underway, we had been waiting to be discharged and it was now past 1pm and the system was down and had been so even before my child‚Äôs surgery. My husband arrives, no one is at the nurse‚Äôs station so he comes to our ward to speak to one of the nurses. To my surprise , this Doctor gets mad that the nurse who clearly isn‚Äôt occupied went to attend to my husband. (Mind you, there were 2 other nurses assisting him making a total of 3.) He angrily flings open the curtain dividing our bed space and the other patient‚Äôs space, exposing where my daughter is sleeping, and begins yelling that the nurse returns at once.  The nurse leaves my husband and his enquiry and returns to continue doing nothing important, just holding a ledger. Imagine yelling angrily over the patient on which he‚Äôs carrying out a procedure, and dissolving into a barrage of rude comments about patients and how the staff shouldn‚Äôt respond to them, or make them feel important. And whose fault is it that the system was down?\n\nI was so shocked. Surely, it must be the patient‚Äôs fault that the hospital‚Äôs system was down. It was probably also our fault that they had no fall back plan and we were to be held hostage until the system is back and running. Whenever that will be. At that point my husband lost it.\n\nLooks like that doctor is dismissive of patients and their rights. Quite belligerent and unpleasant, lacking tact and emotional regulation. Bedside manner, very much lacking. Insulting patients while working on another patient is wild. Wouldn‚Äôt let such a Doctor near me or mine.\nVery unpleasant experience.",

Cedacrest Hospitals is a RED FLAG\n\nThey are huge time wasters, who in all the consultations I‚Äôve had with them make you waste time, with very lethargic and rude staff, who sometimes suggest or avoidable procedures for extra money. For something easily solvable that can be done at home  they get you to come every week for months, so you pay not only fuel but a consultation fee each time\n\nThe receptionist was very rude, lethargic, and unhelpful. I wasn‚Äôt able print the physio form, and he said I didn‚Äôt have to leave, print it and come back. That was the whole reason I was made to wait 4+ hours.\n\nI sent it to his email 4 times, and he didn‚Äôt tell me he didn‚Äôt see it after each time, only telling me when I asked 20 minutes later, then telling me to wait so he can attend to people who came after me, then when he was done he didn‚Äôt check and tell me other alternatives.\nHe even took my phone to the doctor, and I assumed that would mean I can start my vitals as the doctor knew what tests I was going to run. Only for him to tell me 3 hours in, the doctor didn‚Äôt want to look at it from the phone. This problem which was easily solvable by writing the very few tests on a sheet of paper. And when I tried to tell him there were ways to solve the problem, and he wasn‚Äôt being helpful he got angry and upset at me?!?!?!!?\n\nwhy will I wait 4+hours (since 10am ) because I want to do a physical only to see a doctor for 5 minutes, who literally told me I have to come back tomorrow morning for the tests, and then come back again  tomorrow afternoon to see him.\n\nAnd for the tests I could do today the receptionist wanted to keep me waiting an indefinite amount of time, while he attended to himself and people who came hours after me, and all this wait was for him to tell me the name of the test and where I should go to take it. So in the end I had to leave so I can actually eat and do something before I‚Äôm now going back for more long wait times to do the test\n\nSo that‚Äôs 15k and nearly 5  hours of my life wasted, with literally no food, and a flat phone battery. Just for the receptionist to tell me I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot being grateful‚Äù as if I wasn‚Äôt patient for hours while he ignored and didn‚Äôt try and solve the problem, as if he didn‚Äôt waste my time to print two pieces of paper. Then later they‚Äôll tell you to recommend their hospital to someone else, while receptionists carry baseless audacity and useless pride to talk to a paying customer, who has brought over 5 patients to their establishment",

You have to arrive super early to avoid long wait times, and even then, you have to wait for the doctors to arrive. The road leading to the hospital is very bad, has been for years, and causes traffic jam leading to the hospital.\n\nThe reception staff are either nice to you or rude depending on their moods. The waiting area is not very comfortable, with cold metal seats. I came in a few times to see general physicians, and I never felt like I had continuity of care, even when I saw the same physician I last saw. Issues were treated as separate instead of being looked at as part of the big picture of my health. One doctor spent both of my consultations with her accosting and questioning me about being unmarried, and preaching the gospel to me.\n\nI‚Äôve found my experience with Cedarcrest to be unsatisfactory and am now looking for a new hospital. Generally, I‚Äôm impressed by their range of services and they seem to have high quality equipment.

In the process of taking my swab test, I was upset and uncomfortable because the consultant‚Äôs female assistant kept making some unpleasant and disturbing comments. She even threatened to refer me to the male lab assistant to do the swab test if I didn‚Äôt comply, just because I was in pain and discomfort, which she could clearly see as she isn‚Äôt blind. My husband and I couldn‚Äôt do much or say what was on our minds at the time because of the position I was in. My husband was really upset about it as well, as we later confirmed that she was very unprofessional and a parrot.\n\nFurthermore, the female gynaecologist was giving off some negative attitude, and she was rude to my husband just because he wanted to ask a few questions about the test result. I found her behaviour saucy, rude and very unprofessional. I am very disappointed as I expected more from such a big and expensive hospital. At the end of the day, we couldn‚Äôt get any further advice on the test result  because of their delay and sluggishness. We had to get answers from somewhere else. One thing is certain, I won‚Äôt be visiting this hospital again and I‚Äôll be happy to share my experience with anyone who ask‚Äôs me about the hospital‚Äôs services.",

  "text": "It's a horrible experience at cedarcrest hospital; gudu today.  7th may 2022 . First time am using this hospital .Took my son to the hospital as early as 8am. Complaints were of the normal malaria. Headache. Etc. Doctor sent for a laboratory test.... test came out four hours later... It's almost 6pm and yet to see a doctor!. The procedures are flawed; cumbersome; and it looks like the hospital lacks good administration . As far as am concerned the hospital can only boost of big buildings and many astetics to make the high bills they charge worth it. If you ask me ; it's so about making money and less about the patient. How can you be in a private hospital for 10 hours just for malaria!  Even the public general hospitals can do better.\n\nMy advice; if you or your loved ones needs quick medical attention.. You might want to think twice if you have cedarcrest hospital in mind.",

  "text": "If it was possible to rate a ZERO star, I would. These people are so money-oriented that it is hard to see how they make 'caring for their patient' their mission.\nFor a hospital that claim to be a specialist hospital carrying out elective surgeries, it is a massive shock that their ICU facilities and expertise are below-par.\nForget about being operated on in this hospital for simple surgeries as you may just get post-operative complications that they cannot even treat.\n\nMy family and I just wish that we found honest recommendations before taking our relatives there for surgeries as they sadly lost their lives under the so-called care of the medical staff in this hospital. We were willing to pay for their services to ensure that good professional care would be given.  Imagine in the course of care, certain drugs were not procured for our family member because they were deemed 'too expensive' even though it was vital and that lead to admission into ICU on their premises. We promptly paid every single kobo that they charged us but still they did not see it fit to give the standard of care expected of them. How sad and extremely disappointing.\n\nICU expertise is RUBBISH. If they cannot treat patients properly, they should send to an appropriately staffed ICU elsewhere instead of charging for what they cannot do.\n\nWhen my aunty had an accident, she was first taken there and having found out in the nick of time about the deaths of her relatives in the same hospital, she quickly arranged to be transfered to elsewhere where she made good recovery. We later learnt that the rates of deaths have actually been high in this hospital.\n\nThis hospital should be downgraded to a clinic. I note that other reviewers mention 'state-of-the-art equipment' which means little if the expertise is seriously lacking.\n\nIt is these kind of estsblishments that make us think that medical tourism should continue in this country until the healthcare system drastically improve.\n\nFor those reading or thinking of being a patient in this hospital, enter this hospital solely at your risk if you do not value your life. You have been advised and warned!!",

She claimed x-ray report cannot be issued because examination was a patient request. This was not the case in other hospitals, patients have rights to request any examination they want provided there is reasonable grounds. It even became more cynical and dubious that this Doctor covered up hairline fracture at the tip of my right thumb in her issued report after I got lawyers involved. But she was exposed by scan reports from Echo-Scan and Garki hospital which reported and concluded fracture.\nFurthermore, despite spending nearly half a million Naira for MRI scan for my entire spine they got my date of birth wrong and claimed it was my fault. It is needless to mention that day and month stated as my date of birth was the date of my MRI scan examination was performed at this hopsital. The staff in this hospital including Dr Osuagwu are so dishonest. Bewarned!! I am now contacting Human Rights for assistance in recovery of money paid to this hospital.
