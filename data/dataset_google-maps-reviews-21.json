  "text": "This is one of the worst hospitals I have ever used. I came from PH to Abuja I didnâ€™t plant to fall sick I ran some tests and I was placed on injections for two days morning and night. I told the doctor who happens to also be the owner of the hospital the situation that my last foster should be written to refer me to my doctor in portharcourt. The doctor was pissed about it until I insisted. I didnâ€™t argue to pay the bills so why canâ€™t I be given what I asked for when I know itâ€™s actually My right to know what medication Iâ€™m being treated with? Shows thereâ€™s some kind of fundamental problem and unfortunately this is Nigeria and I doubt the right authorities are looking into this. Another thing I observed is everybody has their favourite patients if they donâ€™t know you they donâ€™t treat you right. Never again would I come here or refer any other person .",
