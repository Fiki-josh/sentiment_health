You could work on your turnaround time though (how long it takes to see MOs) and consider installing a speaker or buzzer so doctors don't keep shouting out patient's names when it's their turn to see them. One of the first hospitals in Abuja to switch to electronic file system. The best example that Public Private Partnership can work. Keep it up guys.\n\nUpdate: 2024 üìå\nStill pretty much a good hospital. But the service can sometimes be inefficient and lacking, particularly doctors. They may sometimes just get up and leave (with no notice to waiting patients), disregard for the waiting queue and just general poor attitude.\n\nSometimes you feel like they‚Äôre doing you a favour. A good question: Are your doctors happy to work for GHA? The general attitude is one that lacks empathy. It‚Äôs just a sad situation.\n\nSome days you meet good doctors. Most days, they just seem disconnected. On their phones, distracted. I suggest some form of reorientation of your GOPD docs and feedback from them to really know what goes on in their mind when they are at work.\n\nMaybe motivation, maybe work environment, something doesn‚Äôt feel right. ü§ù",

This happened December 2020 and I will never forget it. In the middle of the night, the gas finished and there was no nurse in sight at the VIP ward, I had to go in search knocking at the nursing station where the nurse was sleeping and appeared highly bothered by me because no one was responding to the call bell, at which point she then calls the maintenance to let them know that the gas had finished. Then the rude nurses kept lying that they will bring gas and they never did until the next day in the middle of the afternoon as my father's condition worsened. The doctors and consultants were never available and blaze whenever they did their ward rounds. We had to buy our gas from outside the hospital because they kept running out of gas and even at that we needed to get permission to bring in the gas. We eventually made arrangements to move my father to another hospital and their nurses refused to accompany him, at which point it was too late. Zero empathy from the medical staff at this hospital. My life will never be the same again because of Garki Hospital.",
