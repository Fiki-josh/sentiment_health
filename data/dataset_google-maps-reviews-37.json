  "text": "The facilities,equipment  medical, nursing team and the nursing care is amazing. However to ensure patients and beneficiaries get complete and complementary healthcare services, the hospital has to improve on the infection prevention and control especially in the wards. The cleaning is so awful and it’s evident that either the cleaners have no basic training or not performing their duties well. The diet; lack of proper balanced diet, no fruits, vegetables and cold food served to the patients. What I couldn’t fathom was how the management allows construction and renovation works that completely take away the peace and tranquility from the patients go on from 8-5. How does the management expect their patients to heal well with poor diet, unclean environment and in a noisy environment? This is so against the natural reasons",

Although it's on the higher end of the price spectrum, the quality of care and efficiency make it well worth the investment.\nOne of the standout features is the remarkably quick turnaround time for blood test results - just 30 minutes or less! Additionally, wait times to see a doctor are minimal, making the entire experience hassle-free.\n\nThe hospital's staff are truly exceptional - the nurses are friendly, professional, and dedicated to providing top-notch care. The front desk receptionists are polite and welcoming, making you feel at ease from the moment you arrive.\n\nThe admission rooms are surprisingly cozy and neat, rivaling those of a hotel! If not for the medical equipment, you could easily mistake it for a comfortable vacation room.\n\nThe Gynaecology department is top-notch, and I recently had a fantastic experience with the Ophthalmology department as well. The level of expertise and care is impressive, and I highly recommend Nizamiye Hospital to anyone seeking exceptional medical attention in Abuja.",

They encourage patients sharing experiences as it boosts morale especially when you have to get a procedure done.\n\nThe room, cleanliness, food, toilet, care package you receive when admitted are all thoughtfully put together.

Within these five days , the doctor just come to see the baby one time per day and stayed few minutes. The hospital charged this few minutes 21250 one time.\nThat's really unreasonable, we went to see the doctor in his office , we need to pay 21250 , under his treatment , it didn't work well he went to see the baby in ward, we have to pay 21250 again. This is not a hospital, this is a robber. Before leaving the hospital, i asked some doctors and nurses in the hospital , all of them said this fee no need to pay. but the cashier said we need to pay first because we need to discharge , and come to the hospital next day, they will refund to us. when we go to the hospital next day, the cashier office refused to refund and said the doctor come to see the patient many times, so they have to charge one time. that's really ridiculous, because the doctor just come one time per day and even their own doctors and nurses said this fee we should not pay. I don't know why how a cashier have to charge this. however, what can we do when they refuse to refund. Is there any organization that manages these hospitals?\nAllah will not forgive them, robber!",

The nurses are the worst. They never do their duties and leave the patient to your care. My grandma just had surgery and when she was wheeled out of the theater, the nurses left. She had to stay a few extra days and those were the worse. I was ready to pay extra half a million for 3 days just for recovery but that would not include the nurses taking care of her. We needed to pay extra. This hospital is just out to make money and their strategy is awful. Very cold and mean inexperienced staff. My grandma almost died. We had to bring her back home.

Inexperienced doctors and nurses kept in emergency period who don't have the least humanity and ample knowledge on how to treat a severe patient. If a patient enters the ward in pain the doctors need to treat them but the system in this hospital says: finish the payment and wait for the nurse... if that's the case then whats the difference between emergency and general ward?? Attending nurse's behavior was so arrogant which I've never seen before because they are supposed to treat you with care. When inserting the IV canola in my hand, I felt pain and complained but she arrogantly answered saying \"I know my job\" and proceeded to give me more pain.... after my birth this is the first time i cried at a hospital. I would like to request the management of this hospital to deploy admins during the night shift as well so the staff can at least act professional instead of behaving like immature people. I also expect serious action against said nurse that attended me tonight, if this isn't done then I will raise my voice even more because today's experience was the worst.",

  "text": "I don’t trust the Doctors and their assistants at this facility. It is overhyped because it is a Turkish owned hospital. I met with a dental specialist today and had to pay N5k for registration and N10k for the initial consultation. I tried explaining my x-ray chart to him and he acted like he didn’t want to listen to what I had to say. Once he was done looking at it, he then tried to listen to me. I explained to him that my lower wisdom teeth had to be extracted and the upper one will be left to grow out before extraction, so as to avoid breaking the bone around the teeth which will lead to severe injury as described by my Dentist in the U.S. But he wanted to extract all the wisdom teeth but at different time interval instead of just the lower ones at different times. I feel like all they want is money and the so called v.i.p patients get better care than regular patients. Additionally, if we are paying high amounts for your service, I believe you should have free WiFi just like the high-end hospitals overseas. Also, please have a meeting and reevaluate the method of customer service that is exhibited by both the doctors and other employees. Besides trying to treat patients problems, also make an effort to listen to them. You might be a medical professional, but the patient knows themselves better than you do, so listening won’t be bad. I just felt so insulted, in the U.S.A my Doctors are always eager to hear what I have to say as I am to them.  No need for any arrogant attitude because you feel your Turkish & better than Nigerian doctors and citizens, I find it low key racist.",

  "text": "This is my most horrible experience since going to Hospitals in Nigeria, I was at this hospital on Monday 27th, directed to see Dr Akif (Consultation fee is 7,500) who  prescribed tests for me. I paid for the tests + their checkup which cost N70,000 . After this , the Doctor said he can't see malaria in my results, that my tests shows am fine but he would give me malaria drugs since am showing signs, I alerted him to the Salmonella typhi that states positive but he said it was insignificant, this was confusing but I decided to let him do his job. I paid 10,000 for ibruprofen, antibiotics and coartem. 3 days later was still sick without any improvement mostly at night. I came back to complain to the doctor and he wrote another test now 18,000. I complained that I have done these same tests on Monday and it's just unreasonable that I am asked to pay for it again . The Manager rudely insisted it is their policy, the doctor was angry because I kept reminding him that he neglected the Typhoid symptoms and the test results.\nI left the hospital Knowing I have to go to another hospital to start all over again. I blame myself for coming here , most times we neglect our own doctors in Nigeria who understand the disease we commonly have here like typhoid and malaria and in the name of top class we fall victim to these hospitals. Nizamey have shown me nothing but incompetency. I advise Nigerians to stay clear if you don't want to waste your hard earned money.",
