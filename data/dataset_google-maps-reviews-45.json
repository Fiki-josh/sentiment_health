She talks to me like I am the last born of her family and I don't know her from Adam. I don't care how old she thinks I am or how old she is. As long as we are not related by blood, marriage or adoption, our relationship is purely professional and should be handled as such. She behaves like government hospital workers who look down on you and speak to their clients condescendingly. I saw how she treated other older clients with respect and professionalism. The management should call her to order and remind her the ethics of hospital customer service as she obviously has none. She has done this repeatedly and I have always excused her unprofessionalism to the high patient-staff ratio. I observed her on Tuesday again and I realized she has always been deliberately rude to me. If she doesn't change, I won't ignore this the next time I visit the hospital. Thank you.",

The nurses arenâ€™t properly trained and behave so entitled. 2 Drs couldnâ€™t find a vein to re insert a canular that wasnâ€™t secured properly in the first place and insisted on poking my 18 month old sons hands and legs for a drug that could be administered intramuscularly. The peadiatrician prescribed paracetamol orally but the nurse showed up with an injection and insisted it was faster when I asked (thatâ€™s after all the pokes he had already received). The matron called to me to discharge me after the pediatrician had told me told that my son will be observed till the following day even though he wasnâ€™t complete Stable ... I could go and on an overall bad experience....",
