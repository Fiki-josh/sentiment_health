After filling the form we were directed to the nursing where there was nobody and casually asked to sit and wait for about 30mins without any explanation. All these while my daughter was still having difficulty breathing. Eventually a nurse showed up to take her vitals. About 15mins later, the doctor trolled in. While in his office he kept talking as if he he was speaking to himself. Later he handed over the swap sample to me asking me to locate the lab and submit it. Instead of showing me the way to the lab, the lady at the front desk asked me to sit a while again with the sample in my hand while my daughter was still struggling to breathe.

  "text": "I actually came in with the mindset that I have Typhoid fever because I was experiencing severe abdominal pain. Upon medical check up by the Chief Medical Doctor, he diagnosed that I have Appendicitis which i knew of but didn't operate on it for the past 14 years ago. That same day that I came in for the check up, I was prepared for the procedure and it went successfully. From previous experience of people I knew, my experience has been different because it has been wonderful and painless, all thanks to Surgeon Dr Brian with his magical hands and Dr Onuh who supervised the procedure. I must say, the general service of the Hospital along with the Nurse's services has been beautiful and top notch.",
