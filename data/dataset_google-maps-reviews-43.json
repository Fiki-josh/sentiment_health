For HMO patients the verification is seamless as long as your cover is valid you’re getting the care needed. Computerized process is also refreshing as you referred to various departments, your digital file is already there ahead of you. Overall, just the way you’d expect a modern health facility to operate. Kudos too to the relatively young and vibrant healthcare professionals over there 💪",

When I first arrived at the hospital, a woman in some uniform came to me and pleaded with me to bear with the delay as I waited longer than normal to see the doctor, she explained that the doctor was busy in the theatre. The doctor was such a nice and personable person. The hospital didn’t have the drugs I needed so the doctor wrote a referral and asked me to follow up with my HMO company, as I type this message, I have not received the drugs that I was told I would get within a maximum 2 hour time frame. The hospital is not taking calls, I’ve been calling since yesterday afternoon. The two stars rating I gave is only for the doctor and the woman that came to attend to me the beginning.",
