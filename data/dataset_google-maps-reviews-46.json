I received a top notch care in kelina clinics . I wanted to go to the US for the procedures i did , but after i was advised by a doctor friend that it can be effectively at kelina . I had to carry out my research on the clinics and the doctors .\nDrs Nadosa and Undie were excellent . I thank them immensely . I advise the government to give hospitals and clinics like kelina grant for them to continue to save lives and do what they know best . The country will save a lot in foreign exchange through drastic reduction in medical tourism .\nIndeed , the saying , what we are looking for in sokoto is in our shokoto .\nKudos to management and staff of kelina clinics\n\nGbenga",

I had a positive perception of the hospital despite never being there, that‚Äôs why I urged my aunt to take my cousin there three days ago. Their focus on extracting the highest amount of money made them to demand ridiculous and ultimately unnecessary treatment options, tests and drugs, which led to his death. It was crazy and I still can‚Äôt believe that the hospital I rated highly could be that callous and irresponsible with lives. We live in a country with few consequences for irresponsibility that‚Äôs why no one really gives a damn about pursuing legal options to ensure the negligence of hospitals are punished.
