For a Dr.on duty who had to be called before she showed up to work ….Servicom number switched off….compound nurse office number switched off??? What is the use of accident and emergency unit if no one will there to attend to the patient… Dear ICT. AS USUAL DO YOUR BEST BY DELETING COMMENT.No wonder the hospital is always empty….",

  "text": "I had an extremely distressing experience at the karu general hospital. Despite my sister being in so much pain, she was left unattended to for far too long. The doctors and nurses displayed an extremely shocking lack of empathy and professionalism, which only added to the intense pain she was already feeling. It felt as though patient care was their last priority. I expected a standard of compassion and attentiveness, but instead, we left the hospital feeling worse than when we arrived. This hospital needs to seriously re-evaluate its approach to patient care.\n\nMy candid advice for anyone who is thinking of going to this hospital for care/treatment, if you don’t want to lose your life for something that ideally should take your life, avoid this hospital.",
