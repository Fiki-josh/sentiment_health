Immediately, my heart accepted it and I felt peace instantly. After attending the free fibroid screening and consultation at their Abuja hospital in July, 2023 I Made up my mind to have my surgery done here and I do not regret it. You'll know the CMD is intentional about the wellbeing of his patients from how all the staff (from doctors to security personnel) treat patients. The hospitality, preoperative care and postoperative care is 5 star. The doctors and nurses are all awesome. Special appreciation to Dr. Abiodun, Dr. Gloria, Nrs. Onuh, Nrs.

They understood that sometimes patients can be difficult, but they never let it affect the quality of care they provided.The hospital staff displayed remarkable professionalism, patience, and compassion throughout my treatment. The medical team's competence, clear communication, and commitment to patient comfort were outstanding. The hospital's attention to detail, efficiency in administrative processes, and effective communication with both patients and their families were particularly noteworthy. I wholeheartedly recommend Abiodun Falade Hospitals to anyone seeking high-quality medical care especially for fibroids and reproductive healthcare. All of the staff go beyond and above the call of duty. They turned my initial crankiness into genuine appreciation.
