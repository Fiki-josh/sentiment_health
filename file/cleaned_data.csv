Nisa Premier Hospital,5,Oluwaseun Timothy,Nisa Premier Hospital's brand is indeed a leading brand in terms of healthcare delivery in Africa.

Nisa Premier Hospital,1,Iyo Obie,"My experience today, Sat 18th Jan 2025, left a very sour taste in my mouth. I came with my child to see a pediatrician cos he was running fever. On getting to the hospital, I was asked to make a payment at the pay-point, to see the doctor, so I made a transfer because I wasn't with my card.

After over 1:30hr of waiting for confirmation of my payment, I was told the person or persons at the accounts don't work on weekends so they aren't picking their calls.

Why run a 24hr hospital service if you can't do the most common thing of confirming payments? Why not provide alternative ways of confirming payments since the people who are to do that don't work on weekends?

After over 1:30hrs, I was able to see the doctor, she recommended some tests and I took my son  to the lab. Again, I needed to make payment for the test. After taking samples, I had to wait extra 35 minutes before they could process the samples because the payment needed to reflect on his card and the guy at the pay point was waiting for the people at the accounts that don't work on weekends to confirm payment.

The level of incompetence at the pediatric clinic is alarming! I am not coming back here!",Jabi,"{'lat': 9.0676555, 'lng': 7.4115661}",Hospital,Abuja,a month ago,,NEGATIVE,0.999459445476532,Less than a year ago

Nisa Premier Hospital,1,Dee Baby,"My first experience at Nisa was during a friend’s surgery and when I relocated to Abuja with my pregnancy, I decided to register there for my antenatal and that was the biggest mistake of my life.

Here are a few things to note:
1) if you know you have no medical emergency and can afford to wait, you can proceed there. Because it’s as crowded as a government hospital & their appointment time isn’t respected.
2) it’s about the money
3) the system is highledy-piggledy.

I was first charged for the hospital card and then the antenatal fee before proceeding to even meet a Dr who later sent me for confirmation of pregnancy. Wasn’t that suppose to be the first thing? But I never doubted their process.
To my utmost dismay and chagrin, after the scan and pcv, I was asked to go and come back when my pregnancy gets to 12 weeks (to them that’s when pregnancy is said to be fully established & safe beyond miscarriage).
Mogbe! So why did you let me pay for antenatal? They said they were wondering who asked me to pay. That I was to see the Dr before making payment. How was I to know?
I went back to the receptionist and all he told me was “I am so sorry. God will make it stay. Nothing will happen”. Hmmmm!
That’s how I left to go and pray for nothing to happen. Unfortunately I lost the baby, then the drama started when I went to ask for a refund.
From going round accounting blocks because every room we went said they stopped handling that (dunno what they meant). After filling the form was asked to leave, that I’ll get a feedback.
After weeks of back and forths, I finally got a refund after they deducted money for O & G consultation/ lab test.
So I just walked into Nisa to waste money and watch myself miscarry.
A simple “we only register 12 weeks pregnancies for antenatal” would have helped. It was just a confused system.",Jabi,"{'lat': 9.0676555, 'lng': 7.4115661}",Hospital,Abuja,7 months ago,,NEGATIVE,0.9995701909065247,Less than a year ago

It's not done anywhere in the world that you're given a bill to pay without being given a breakdown of the services you accessed. And then a very rude and crude Nurse James and the very rude front desk officer as well. How can medications that you didn't use and don't intend going home with still be billed to you? And when they were asked to take it out, they said 'medications already dispensed cannot be returened' where on earth is that done? This is broad daylight robbery and is highly disappointing for a hospital of your standard. Make provision for the patient to have access to their bill regardless of the day or time as this will enhance transparency. We shouldn't have to wait till when the 'billers' are available before we can get a comprehensive statement of our hospital bills please. And please, teach nurse James how be more professional and nice and more diplomatic when attending to patients.

Nisa Premier Hospital,1,Peter Abah,"I thought I was visiting a private hospital but the experience is nothing different from a public hospital.

My experience today 2/11/22 wasn't a pleasant one.

Firstly, the disconnect between the front desk, medical officer and the specialist (obstetrician) is begging for improvement.

Secondly, the so called obstetrician probably a registrar that I saw today by 4:23pm was unprofessional and lacks empathy; She was distracted with personal calls and unapologetic about it, no introductions, no smile, unperturbed and like questions being asked were irrelevant as she tactically avoided them and her feedback was like one that's exhausted.

Going back to the front desk to get antenatal care package, I was told they will give me a matron's phone number to call, like I am right here in the hospital and I have to use my personal line to call a staff? Wow!!! No systems in place??

The long waiting time I ran away from in public hospitals was right here waiting and smiling at me.

I had to go online and look at the hospital reviews because my visit today was as a result of a friend's recommendation years ago. But disappointed because if the management have been seeing the reviews there should be an improvement or is it a BOT that replies to all reviews?

I think the management need to use mystery clients or do a survey and discover the rot in the system.

There's room for continuous quality improvement and training of staff on emotional Intelligence.

And as an expecting Mum I want to be looked after properly and know my hospital is reliable there's just too much long and unnecessary methods with the tests and all .

Nisa Premier Hospital,1,Faisal Farouq,"If I could give zero (0) or negative stars to this hospital, I will because NISA hospital services and patient treatment does not even deserve the one star.
I took my wife for a doctor's appointment booked for 11am. They kept us waiting till around 2pm to see the doctor whom prescribed tests and scans to be done. After the tests and scans I asked for the results which they said will be available before her next appointment and we can pick up then.
On the day of the said appointment I called to reconfirm and let them know that we are coming, only for them to tell me that they have removed her from the appointment list. I insisted to speak with one of their managers, he said he will rectify and call me back. Hours later when I didn't hear from him, I called back to reconfirm, only for this rude manager to tell me that ""doctor is busy, but if you insist on seeing him today you can come and beg the nurses maybe they will allow you see him"".
Naturally I got angry that after all we have paid and gone through, a Manager will tell us to come and beg to see a doctor, as if the service was free.
So I went down to the hospital and demanded to get the test results printed so that I could take my wife to see a doctor elsewhere. The manager, nurses, front desk, all ganged up on me and refused to give the test results that I paid for with my own money. Test results worth almost 100,000 naira. As I write this feedback, they are still holding my wife's test results. We had to go to a different hospital and start the consultation process all over again.

Nisa Premier Hospital,2,Mohammed Onalo,"""I had a really terrible experience with this hospital, and it's gonna be hard to forget. During my antenatal visit to the hospital in the middle of January this year, the doctor had told me she was gonna refer me to the gynaecologist since my due date was near and there was no sign labour was gonna come naturally. So I was booked. That same day, I complained to the doc about my older child and I having cough, catarrh and sore throat and she recommended some meds. (This had been my complaint since I approached 3rd trimester).

I met with the gynaecologist who also confirmed what the doc said and asked me to come for induction the following week (my exact EDD). I spoke to a private midwife and she advised me to buy some time, that labour may come naturally since baby and I were confirmed healthy. So I did, and met with one Dr. Abalaka, a gentleman, who gave me few more days to meet with him before finalizing the induction.

Well, before the date of the appointment with Dr. Abalaka of Nisa Premier hospital, I fell into labour on 20th of January 2021. Everything was going on well until I began to cough as soon as I was delivered on the 21st of January. My newborn was also coughing because he had swallowed something. The doc approached me and asked what was wrong with me, told him I had cough and a dry throat. He then called a smallish Asian lady in to check my newborn but she refused to touch him. I noticed the medical personnels around me quietly dispersed and a pregnant patient who was brought in was quickly moved out. The only care that was given to my child was his clothes that were put on. He was denied the right medical care and attention.

Meanwhile my husband and older baby were asked to go wait for me in an isolated ward. The doc approached me and said I was gonna be discharged asap because I had symptoms of covid-19 and needed to go do a test and return after 2 weeks with the results. He also advised me to return to the hospital if I had any complaints within these weeks. We were later discharged that night, with a paper asking us to come the next day to see a paediatrician because my husband and I had let one of the nurses know there were some abnormalities we noticed in our baby.

When I got home I realized my baby had not been given his first shot (immunization) too, so I decided to seek help on the Nisa Premier pregnancy WhatsApp group, where a few mothers informed me that he was supposed to be given before we were discharged, but the group admin removed me from the group after I talked about the ill treatment shown to me at the hospital. So I headed to the hospital the next day, 22nd January 2021.

I met this rude, ill mannered paediatrician named Tunde, who asked me to leave his office, and ordered the place to be cleaned immediately. During the consultation with him, he had called the skinny Asian doc on the phone, and told her ""the lady that was suspected to have covid-19"" was at his office and wanted her child immunized. The skinny lady had asked him to ask me to leave and not touch my child. I heard every word she told him.

He then told me I had covid-19 and I was unreasonable to have been there as I was exposing him and others in the building. He asked me to leave his office and not come back until I was tested. In his words, I WONT TOUCH YOUR BABY, SO YOU CAME HERE TO EXPOSE ALL OF US TO THE DISEASE! Believe me I broke down In tears because it was barely 24 hours that I had been delivered of my baby, and I was shown so much hate, degradation, discrimination and abuse because I was suspected to have Covid-19.

I even went as far as asking him to check my history as the cold had been there for months and I always complained whenever I was there for an antenatal visit, but he chose to treat me like the plague itself, and my child was never checked. I am still hurt, disappointed and full of regrets.""

That was my wife's review on their official page.I was there. Terrible experience.The neonatal doctor we saw is a terrible human. No single drop of concern for a new born baby.Wonder how he became a doctor",Jabi,"{'lat': 9.0676555, 'lng': 7.4115661}",Hospital,Abuja,4 years ago,,NEGATIVE,0.9945401549339294,4 years ago

NYSC doctors are assigned to NHIS patients; even children see non-paediatric doctors; test results take 2 hours even malaria test; drugs are the least in the range. NHIS patients are not valued here but if you are paying cash then you are king. Services are expensive and maybe the reason why cash paying patients are given preference.

Cedarcrest Hospitals Ltd,2,,"In all my years of visiting hospitals, never have I encountered such a Doctor as one Dr Kolawole (Obgyn). I think that’s his name.
My daughter was admitted post surgery and the next day was sleeping while we were waiting to be discharged. This Doctor comes into the ward to do a procedure for a pregnant woman. While that is underway, we had been waiting to be discharged and it was now past 1pm and the system was down and had been so even before my child’s surgery. My husband arrives, no one is at the nurse’s station so he comes to our ward to speak to one of the nurses. To my surprise , this Doctor gets mad that the nurse who clearly isn’t occupied went to attend to my husband. (Mind you, there were 2 other nurses assisting him making a total of 3.) He angrily flings open the curtain dividing our bed space and the other patient’s space, exposing where my daughter is sleeping, and begins yelling that the nurse returns at once.  The nurse leaves my husband and his enquiry and returns to continue doing nothing important, just holding a ledger. Imagine yelling angrily over the patient on which he’s carrying out a procedure, and dissolving into a barrage of rude comments about patients and how the staff shouldn’t respond to them, or make them feel important. And whose fault is it that the system was down?

I was so shocked. Surely, it must be the patient’s fault that the hospital’s system was down. It was probably also our fault that they had no fall back plan and we were to be held hostage until the system is back and running. Whenever that will be. At that point my husband lost it.

Looks like that doctor is dismissive of patients and their rights. Quite belligerent and unpleasant, lacking tact and emotional regulation. Bedside manner, very much lacking. Insulting patients while working on another patient is wild. Wouldn’t let such a Doctor near me or mine.

The attitude of the staff on the other hand is appalling. Cedacrest Hospitals is a RED FLAG

They are huge time wasters, who in all the consultations I’ve had with them make you waste time, with very lethargic and rude staff, who sometimes suggest or avoidable procedures for extra money. For something easily solvable that can be done at home  they get you to come every week for months, so you pay not only fuel but a consultation fee each time

The receptionist was very rude, lethargic, and unhelpful. I wasn’t able print the physio form, and he said I didn’t have to leave, print it and come back. That was the whole reason I was made to wait 4+ hours.

I sent it to his email 4 times, and he didn’t tell me he didn’t see it after each time, only telling me when I asked 20 minutes later, then telling me to wait so he can attend to people who came after me, then when he was done he didn’t check and tell me other alternatives.
He even took my phone to the doctor, and I assumed that would mean I can start my vitals as the doctor knew what tests I was going to run. Only for him to tell me 3 hours in, the doctor didn’t want to look at it from the phone. This problem which was easily solvable by writing the very few tests on a sheet of paper. And when I tried to tell him there were ways to solve the problem, and he wasn’t being helpful he got angry and upset at me?!?!?!!?

why will I wait 4+hours (since 10am ) because I want to do a physical only to see a doctor for 5 minutes, who literally told me I have to come back tomorrow morning for the tests, and then come back again  tomorrow afternoon to see him.

And for the tests I could do today the receptionist wanted to keep me waiting an indefinite amount of time, while he attended to himself and people who came hours after me, and all this wait was for him to tell me the name of the test and where I should go to take it. So in the end I had to leave so I can actually eat and do something before I’m now going back for more long wait times to do the test

So that’s 15k and nearly 5  hours of my life wasted, with literally no food, and a flat phone battery. Just for the receptionist to tell me I’m “not being grateful” as if I wasn’t patient for hours while he ignored and didn’t try and solve the problem, as if he didn’t waste my time to print two pieces of paper. Then later they’ll tell you to recommend their hospital to someone else, while receptionists carry baseless audacity and useless pride to talk to a paying customer, who has brought over 5 patients to their establishment",Apo,"{'lat': 8.9927062, 'lng': 7.487031}",Private hospital,Abuja,3 months ago,,NEGATIVE,0.9990904331207275,Less than a year ago

The entire experience of seeking care at cedar crest is frustrating and anxiety inducing. You have to arrive super early to avoid long wait times, and even then, you have to wait for the doctors to arrive. The road leading to the hospital is very bad, has been for years, and causes traffic jam leading to the hospital.

The reception staff are either nice to you or rude depending on their moods. The waiting area is not very comfortable, with cold metal seats. I came in a few times to see general physicians, and I never felt like I had continuity of care, even when I saw the same physician I last saw. Issues were treated as separate instead of being looked at as part of the big picture of my health. One doctor spent both of my consultations with her accosting and questioning me about being unmarried, and preaching the gospel to me.

Cedarcrest Hospitals Ltd,1,,"If it was possible to rate a ZERO star, I would. These people are so money-oriented that it is hard to see how they make 'caring for their patient' their mission.
For a hospital that claim to be a specialist hospital carrying out elective surgeries, it is a massive shock that their ICU facilities and expertise are below-par.
Forget about being operated on in this hospital for simple surgeries as you may just get post-operative complications that they cannot even treat.

My family and I just wish that we found honest recommendations before taking our relatives there for surgeries as they sadly lost their lives under the so-called care of the medical staff in this hospital. We were willing to pay for their services to ensure that good professional care would be given.  Imagine in the course of care, certain drugs were not procured for our family member because they were deemed 'too expensive' even though it was vital and that lead to admission into ICU on their premises. We promptly paid every single kobo that they charged us but still they did not see it fit to give the standard of care expected of them. How sad and extremely disappointing.

ICU expertise is RUBBISH. If they cannot treat patients properly, they should send to an appropriately staffed ICU elsewhere instead of charging for what they cannot do.

When my aunty had an accident, she was first taken there and having found out in the nick of time about the deaths of her relatives in the same hospital, she quickly arranged to be transfered to elsewhere where she made good recovery. We later learnt that the rates of deaths have actually been high in this hospital.

This hospital should be downgraded to a clinic. I note that other reviewers mention 'state-of-the-art equipment' which means little if the expertise is seriously lacking.

It is these kind of estsblishments that make us think that medical tourism should continue in this country until the healthcare system drastically improve.

For those reading or thinking of being a patient in this hospital, enter this hospital solely at your risk if you do not value your life. You have been advised and warned!!",Apo,"{'lat': 8.9927062, 'lng': 7.487031}",Private hospital,Abuja,7 years ago,,NEGATIVE,0.9979586601257324,5 years and above

She claimed x-ray report cannot be issued because examination was a patient request. This was not the case in other hospitals, patients have rights to request any examination they want provided there is reasonable grounds. It even became more cynical and dubious that this Doctor covered up hairline fracture at the tip of my right thumb in her issued report after I got lawyers involved. But she was exposed by scan reports from Echo-Scan and Garki hospital which reported and concluded fracture.
Furthermore, despite spending nearly half a million Naira for MRI scan for my entire spine they got my date of birth wrong and claimed it was my fault. It is needless to mention that day and month stated as my date of birth was the date of my MRI scan examination was performed at this hopsital.

DEDA Hospital,2,Avalanche Shaibu,"Subject: Complaint Regarding Excessive Wait Times for Antenatal Visits

Dear Deda Management,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction with the antenatal services I have received at your hospital. After leaving my previous hospital due to mismanagement and the fact that my doctor moved to your hospital, I chose to trust your facility with my antenatal care, paying for the full service. Unfortunately, the wait times I have experienced have been excessively long and deeply frustrating.

During my first and second visits, I waited nearly four hours to see a doctor, which is far beyond what should be considered reasonable. My third visit was even worse, as I ended up waiting more than four hours, with only one doctor available to attend to patients. As someone who is pregnant, managing stress and taking care of my health is a priority. However, spending hours waiting for medical attention is not only exhausting but also adds unnecessary stress.

While I do appreciate the friendly and polite attitude of your staff, the wait times are unacceptable and do not reflect the level of care I expected. Unfortunately, based on my experience, I cannot recommend your hospital to others unless they find waiting for hours enjoyable.

why even ask someone to book an appointment time if we still have to come and wait.

I hope you will take this feedback seriously and work towards improving your service, especially considering the needs of expectant mothers.",Kado,"{'lat': 9.1008754, 'lng': 7.4503049}",Hospital,Abuja,4 months ago,,NEGATIVE,0.8808813095092773,Less than a year ago

Worse of all, the only road leading there is one of the worst in Abuja. Save your precious time and not go there, because It's just not worth driving on the bad road leading there, only to find out that what you went there for doesn't exist

All these five stars you see here are probably left by locals who're use to typical ""Nigerian Low Standard of Service"". So they're clueless about what constitute a  good service",Kado,"{'lat': 9.1008754, 'lng': 7.4503049}",Hospital,Abuja,a year ago,,NEGATIVE,0.9996764659881592,1 year ago

Let me start from the not so good.
Accessibility; very poor. The roads leading to the facility are a nightmare, they may however transform to very good when ongoing road construction in the area is completed.
Pricey? Yes it is, very pricey but not as pricey as flying abroad.

Their rooms are spacious and comfortable. I came in and stayeds with my entire family.
If you are looking for the abroad experience in Nigeria, this should be a great match for you.
I actually had a difficult time choosing between two great hospitals within Abuja.
I decided to go for this even when it seemed their rates were estimated and more pricy than the other hospital. Expertise of doctors, level of care from staff, comfort of rooms, flexibility of entire team, were a few things I considered before setting for one.

The doctor even called to check up on me after delivery.

"Federal Medical Centre, Jabi",1,Oluwaseun Boyede,"I am highly disappointed with FMC. I lost a dear friend's mother on Saturday the 21st of September 2024. I must say using inexperienced doctors at the emergency section IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. MOST  staff are so lackadaisical in their attitude. My mum's friend was dying and we are at radiology to run a scan and xray, firstly the attendant that morning (around 3am) had a REALLY NASTY ATTITUDE. Seeing that my friend's mum was vomitting and losting energy I ran back to the emergency wing to get the doctor. The nasty attendant and the radiologist said CPR  can not be performed in the xray room that there is no space for that there, we should take her back to emergency which we did (the wheel her she was on was as slow as a snail) and that is where she took her last breath. Like how can 12 people pass from 11pm to 4am and NO ONE IS ASKING QUESTIONS??????? Now the people at the morgue did ABSOLUTE RUBBISH in embalming her body because when we came to pick her she was put in a non ventilated hot 40ft container near the morgue when we asked why the bodies were not in the building where we left her with others, they said they were queried for using the building that was not commissioned......like wow!!!!! So her body had already started decaying, mind you we came on monday to move her body to Asokoro. The morticians told us that once she is embalmed that she can stay for a week without being in a cold place (freezer) smh we paid 35k for embalming and 8k cash to the morgue office, still we got rubbish service.

"Federal Medical Centre, Jabi",1,Emygamz7 Concepts,"I payed for VIP for my wife’s delivery and this people took me through hell and back.

Let’s ignore the errands I was sent like a child, and even as a vip customer and the distance between the points.

First of all, my wife was put in a general ward that even up to 2am she couldn’t sleep because of heat and mosquito. I had left the hospital and couldn’t come back that late.

Secondly, after delivery up to 24hours they did not take the child close to the mother to breast feed, and after 48hours they are coming to give false reports of jaundice, while the pediatrician check and saw it was false report.

Thirdly, there was no room for we that paid for vip after recovery. They still wanted to push her back into the regular hot ward, but that was were I said, I won’t allow so she was left in observation with strict instructions that she must leave after 24hours.

Fourthly, after making me send over 125k for just delivery items. Many of these items were not used, and they refused to receive it back and refund my balance, please which day light Robert pass this one? I will attach the pictures, you will see.

Fifthly, sending medical students to come and examine and use my wife to experiment,  that I paid for vip treatment?  You guys are jokers!

This whole process for me as a first timer was a very poor and appealing experience, let’s not even talk about the ability of me not being able to see my wife when I want. Or is it the other vip patient that paid for 3 days (90k) and dint have AC in her room? How do I know? She was coming to sleep in the observation ward because of the AC.

No other ward has an AC that’s working for the labour ward.

It is such a pity and shame that your service which you claim is to humanity has not improved even after 4 years. I stopped because I was given the wrong diagnosis twice.

"Federal Medical Centre, Jabi",1,Dononahzio,"I went to the Dental department because I had sensitivity and a pain. The Dentist Emmanuel a dark skin looking man. Performed the procedure after recommending I fill 4 teeth.

Even after my intuition was telling me to not go ahead, I still did, believing it was the right choice based on the word of a professional.

Throughout the process, he was always talking and laughing with other colleagues and not paying full attention to me. Then there was power outage twice. Which stalled the process.

Finally I got home thinking all was well just to find out that a big hole was in my upper tooth and the rest were not filled properly. Even after enduring so much pain, BTW I told him about the pains all he could say was man up basically.

I went back to get it teeth done properly. And he still missed filling the hole completely.

I had to change to another Dental clinic.

What a sad horrific experience.

The hospital staff are so friendly and courteous...the doctors are very available...the hospital is spacious, well planned and well managed. The funny thing is, it isn't as expensive as you would normally expect a private hospital to be. A bed per day costs 3k5...the drug prices are very competitive, they even have their own security outfit complete with attractive uniforms! Have you seen their labs? Omo...madt oh! The only issues I had, there's little or no network for the POS machines in the accounts section so most times if you don't have cash or cannot do a transfer, you might end up being stranded. Then the canteen ...their white rice and stew was wack, like they used 3 weeks old oil to cook the stew. Their Afang soup on the other hand is legendary even though the quantity they serve is quite small...their kpuff kpuff is also amazing. The minimart could use a general facelift though...it holds so much potential but they sell almost nothing. If you don't buy bottled water early enough, you won't get any to buy within the hospital. Asides that and a few annoying nurses, the place is simply amazing! A plus for the bored caregivers, there are numerous beautiful spots for great selfies to be taken.

"DAUGHTERS OF CHARITY OF ST VINCENT DE PAUL HOSPITAL, FO1, KUBWA - ABUJA",1,,"This hospital needs to do more to project the good image of the Church. They take the name of St. Vincent de  Paul and are run ( I believe) by the Daughters  of Charity, but in my experience as an out-patient, this institution has little regard for their patients. They keep patients waiting for hours, after the exorbitant bills, with no doctor on seat  to attend to them. When I visited, the doctors were having a “meeting” for more than three hours and it appeared that as far as they are concerned, the patients could go to hell. A few of their staff were nonchalant about it. I came to the hospital in the morning and I was asked to go for a test- an expensive one at that.  And after waiting for close to four hours with NO doctor on seat, I requested for a copy of the result of the test that I paid for, so I can at least  keep it for my own records and also take it to a doctor at another hospital to review, but no, they won’t give me a copy of my own test result!  They won’t give me a copy of the result of a test  I paid for, because “it’s hospital policy”. When I requested to speak with a supervisor or a high level manager , one of the staff told me I couldn’t. His word is final.
This hospital does not care if the patient has an emergency, he or she has to wait, especially when  “the doctors are having a meeting.”  Lots of frustrated patients raised their voices and the place got chaotic .
There is always room to grow in Christian charity and professionalism in this hospital.  At least with regard to the conduct of the doctor that came to deliver a cold, patronizing  message to the agitated patients to “wait, because this meeting is for your own good” or the staff who told me that his message to me was the final word and I couldn’t seek a recourse with his boss.
Waiting for hours here was an exercise in patience for me.
I must say that when eventually I was attended to, the doctor on seat was kind and pleasant. In addition, I found the lady at the reception and another lady at records to be good professionals who understand customer service . Majority of the staff are great and compassionate. I understand the situation of that day was beyond their control.
The management needs to make sure that patients, who have paid and have been checked in, do not have to wait for hours because “doctors are having a meeting.” The management needs to realize that in their quest for profit, patient care shouldn’t be compromised. They also need to release the result of lab test to the patients, who request for it . It’s absurd that you won’t release a patient’s lab results to him or her. It’s the patient’s right to see and have a copy of the results he or she paid for.",Kubwa,"{'lat': 9.1618518, 'lng': 7.3575308}",Hospital,Dushepe,2 years ago,,NEGATIVE,0.9986086487770081,2 years ago

Wellington Neurosurgery Centre,1,Thames Ocean,"Poorly managed facility for a delicate surgery like brain surgery. The post ops. care is at 10%. About 2 experinced nurses the rest are quacks. The doctors are all inexperienced except the MD, who would prefer to hide medical complications from family of the patient. They are mostly interested in collecting your money but would not deliver even simple patient care - the nurses would not check BP but they will fabricate details of it in the patiants record. I bought BP machine with memory while they claim to be using it, their records and the machine are saying two different things. The nurses would not record high BPs in their book. Your loved one would be deteriorating under them but they are saying he is doing well. The MD is a criminal. He did not interprete all the CT he conducted until I came in contact with another consultant neuro surgeon who told me what is happening. For a procedure that we walked in for unaided. I carried my loved on like a piece of vegetable out of the place.

I encountered them in 2020/2021.

The funny thing is that the MD is sending his inexperienced doctors to write and post nice reviews of the hospital. I spent over 5 months there.
The facility reflects the horrible state of the Nigeria health sector. The experience changed me.",Wuse,"{'lat': 9.0922941, 'lng': 7.4755772}",Specialized hospital,Abuja,a year ago,,NEGATIVE,0.9989049434661865,1 year ago

Wellington Neurosurgery Centre,1,sherina hajj,"My baby was admitted in this hospital and I was to care for her. Guess what? They didn't let me bath the first day stating they have no bathroom since she( baby) was in the ICU. The rude nurse said to me ICU bathroom is like their “official” bathroom so people are not allowed to use it. Why was she (my baby) in the ICU in the first place? Because they had no room to admit her, they asked us to stay in the ICU pending when any room will be vacant. The second day same thing until I insisted and screamed I can’t continue living there without bathing, the same nurse instructed the cleaner to fetch water in one dirty paint bucket for me to have my bath outside, what? Like some little beggar who isn't paying for it's services. That nurse obviously thinks she is working in a government owned hospital where they place their selves above patient. I Complained to admin and admin suggested I go home to bath. I had no home in abuja. Travelled many kilometres to ABJ. I was like a joke to them. If it's not an emergency with no where else to go fine (please make sure you have exhausted all your options) otherwise look elsewhere. They cost as much as other health care facilities you'll get  better care. Don’t let their structure fool you! They cost same with the big names. Also, you won't be dealing with doctors who wouldn't take your issues seriously until Google ask them to (only one experienced doctor which  is the MD, who is available during surgery, post op? You're left with doctors  who google your symptoms before they understand what you're saying). There are some nurses who are at the top of their game, that's all there is to it. If you have Refund? They would rather keep it than refund to who they had buisness with. Bunch of thives who would keep money that isn't theirs. THIEVERY HOSPITAL reason they didn't mind I pay 40k per night without providing bathroom, I don’t want to talk how they ran out of soap and couldn’t clean a messed up room. I’ll be putting up a textbook if I write my whole experience

Previously, I developed an infection before/after stitch removal. Today, I consulted for knee issues and requested an X-ray. The clinic's communication and patient care are non-existent.

Abuja Clinics Nigeria Limited,1,Emma Ginnelly,"This is hands down one of the worst medical centers I have ever had to attend. Including establishments in rural villages, emergency medical centers set up for urgent relief and other hospitals around the world.

The medical team lack basic protocols and the establishment is dirty,  it is extremely unhygienic. They will lie their way through explanations and are very reluctant to give you adequate information regarding your results and treatment. It was the hospital assigned to me with employment and I went there in an emergency.

Recently I had severe diarrhea and vomiting. I went to the hospital they  ran a full bloods, urine, stool culture and urine culture. They admitted me upon entry, which I would agree was the right call- I was very dehydrated and struggling to communicate effectively. After receiving IV treatment for rehydration I was given a broad spectrum antibiotic to tackle infection after my white cell count came back high. They then told me stool culture was clear- after only eight hours, and wouldn't actually show me the results. They put me in a room full of ants, with a toilet that barely flushed and no hot water. I made the decision to tolerate it for the night as I knew I needed to rehydrate.

I wanted to be discharged in the morning which caused major issues- they claimed they wanted to keep me for observation and further tests despite the fact I had not seen a physician since being admitted.

My husband explained to the nurse that I wanted to leave and emphasized the reasons why and she then went and got a senior physician. They make a bit of a drama including getting the head of admin and services down to the poor excuse for a ward. We explained our reasons very well- they admitted two other patients into the room I was in, which I thought was extremely unfair on them as I had stooled 16 times that morning and they didn't know what sort of infection I had yet. It was one badly flushing shared toilet covered in insects, I did not feel it was right for two ill women paying very expensive medical fees to have to share a bathroom with someone who could have something that was contagious.

To come on to the apparently sanitary ward the we were made to wear slippers from the hospital- which they do not wash between wears, at one point a nurse even took her own off to give my husband and genuinely did not see the problem. There are construction workers in and out of the room covered in dust and muck. When the doctor was checking my stomach he stopped to kill a mosquito on the wall. That was still there today (from two days ago). There were dead flies in the consultation room today being eaten by ants and fluids on the desk. He asked why I discharged myself (I was going back for injections) and when I said it was because I wasn't happy with the hospital conditions and hygiene he laughed at me and encouraged his colleague to join in. They do not adequately store their medicine and doctors do not conduct adequate handovers between rounds- they didn't even know which tests I had received, I had to keep telling them when they changed rounds.  We witnessed a doctor walk into what is meant to be a sterile environment in a lab coat he had walked from his transport to the hospital in. I could go on but I don't wish to sound emotional and bitter and the rest of the details are a bit grim and personal.

I would not have written a review at all but after leaving the hospital this evening after going back for a final injection, we bumped into a justifiably distressed mother whose daughter had been misdiagnosed and mistreated resulting in severe consequences. When she told the doctor- he laughed.  He smiled and laughed- at a concerned mother.

Knowledge shared is powerful and I am sure there are some very great staff at Abuja clinics- I feel for them because I can't see how they can flourish. However, I think when it comes to medicine people should have all the information possible to make their decision.  I have only assigned one star as it is required in order to post a review.",Maitama,"{'lat': 9.098612, 'lng': 7.4848659}",Medical Center,Abuja,6 years ago,,NEGATIVE,0.9996013045310974,5 years and above

Update: 2024 
Still pretty much a good hospital. But the service can sometimes be inefficient and lacking, particularly doctors. They may sometimes just get up and leave (with no notice to waiting patients), disregard for the waiting queue and just general poor attitude.

Sometimes you feel like they’re doing you a favour. A good question: Are your doctors happy to work for GHA? The general attitude is one that lacks empathy. It’s just a sad situation.

Some days you meet good doctors. Most days, they just seem disconnected. On their phones, distracted. I suggest some form of reorientation of your GOPD docs and feedback from them to really know what goes on in their mind when they are at work.

I paid for a private ward hoping to get a better experience but it was terrible. Ward round was conducted by student doctors who used my aged mother for experiment. A nurse told me to my face she can refuse to give my mother her medication and nothing will happen. Had to beg the doctor to fasten her discharge. They delay medication by hours. They would wake my mother up mostly at midnight to swallow medicine that clearly had 9pm written on it. I literally have to go and beg for her medication to be given to her and they will say we're busy meanwhile they spend most of the time at the nurse's station gossiping.

The hospital is easily accessible and is Wheelchair-accessible.
Almost all medical services are available here including cosmetic surgery and all sorts of diagnostic tests are run.

What I find really annoying about this hospital is the wait time!
I waited 2 whole hours before I could see a doctor!!!

Spent 3 whole days before I could get a medical report 
The most annoying thing, the first doctor gave me one set of tests to run, the doctor I met the next day added 3 more!
How about the information desk? They were almost clueless as to how to obtain a medical report from here!

The charges nko?! No be here!

Garki Hospital Abuja,1,Mimi Iyortyer,"The worst hospital ever with unsympathetic and uncompassionate nurses. This hospital practically killed my father due to negligence because they kept running out of gas. This happened December 2020 and I will never forget it. In the middle of the night, the gas finished and there was no nurse in sight at the VIP ward, I had to go in search knocking at the nursing station where the nurse was sleeping and appeared highly bothered by me because no one was responding to the call bell, at which point she then calls the maintenance to let them know that the gas had finished. Then the rude nurses kept lying that they will bring gas and they never did until the next day in the middle of the afternoon as my father's condition worsened. The doctors and consultants were never available and blaze whenever they did their ward rounds. We had to buy our gas from outside the hospital because they kept running out of gas and even at that we needed to get permission to bring in the gas. We eventually made arrangements to move my father to another hospital and their nurses refused to accompany him, at which point it was too late. Zero empathy from the medical staff at this hospital.

The treatment I received was effective, and I felt well taken care of during my entire stay. The follow-up care and instructions provided upon discharge were thorough and easy to follow.

You can stand waiting for just a simple answer for 30 minutes from the nurses. Most times they just ignore you or give you a false information that would make you leave them alone. And guess what at my 4th visit I was told they didn't have my records. With my pregnancy I had to go to all the sections I had tests myself to get my results so the doctor can attend to me which took me three hours after waiting already for 3 hours before then just to get my turn to see the doctor at the end of the day the nurse I gave my phone to in trust and confidence stole it and the CCTV was not able to see anything in the footage. I was blamed and finally ignored.  I left there in shock because I couldn't even believe everything that had happened. I broke down afterwards due to the stress of that day as my legs were shaking from walking everywhere from 10am to 5:30pm. I heard it's because they are not well paid so they take it out on the patients. I don't know how true that is. . That was my last day there.",Garki,"{'lat': 9.0426781, 'lng': 7.4952213}",Hospital,Abuja,2 years ago,,NEGATIVE,0.999678373336792,2 years ago

They also had specialists that came in routinely to check on the babies.

I don’t know about other departments but the NICU department was very supportive honestly.
I just want to use this opportunity to tell people that NHA has the capacity to care for premature babies and they are very affordable compared to private hospitals.

It is difficult to leave your vulnerable little one in the hands of strangers, but those nurses are very nice, they understand the task they have been given and they do it with every care in the world.

At the emergencies, there's often delay in attending to patients and often times there are limited bedspaces for instant admissions. Cost of laboratory inquiries are also a bit expensive. Expert health care service providers anyways. To conclude this, the mosquitoes here, especially at night time are more than those in all the rural areas of the FCT combined. Great hospitality can be achieved here if the government would fund the hospital better. As I write this review, I'm currently here at the Hospital. This is 1.30Hrs. I can't sleep. The mosquitoes!

I told the doctor who happens to also be the owner of the hospital the situation that my last foster should be written to refer me to my doctor in portharcourt. The doctor was pissed about it until I insisted. I didn’t argue to pay the bills so why can’t I be given what I asked for when I know it’s actually My right to know what medication I’m being treated with? Shows there’s some kind of fundamental problem and unfortunately this is Nigeria and I doubt the right authorities are looking into this.

Third, you can hardly find staff on their seats, you have to wait for them to be located by their colleagues before you are attended to. This isn't a one day experience but a usual occurrence.

Thank God i discharged myself and left for another hospital.
I have been using you guys since I came to abuja but over the time I think something went wrong along the line , all your good doctors have left . You people were just pumping me with pcm injection and asking me stupid questions over and over  . How can see seven different doctors and none of them could even start me on malaria treatment after telling each of them I do not always show symptoms. You all have turned to money making machine. Thank God i discharged myself , by the time I got to the other hospital I was wheeled in , and they started treating immediately and I got better under 30mins . Please stay away from limi hospital, their doctors don’t listen (although they will act as if they are), doctors will lock themselves in and not attend to their patients because they are tired hence the long waiting line , nurses are rude(cardio care nurse ), I was told to go for emergency xray can you imagine the radiology telling me I will need to wait till Friday for the result because the doctor in charge was on leave . They will not update your chat I almost did another echo scan because the one I did was not updated , I don’t even think the doctor read it , cause I had to explain over and over to 7 different doctors.
Well well To the people that were nice to me Dr Rotimi in gynecology(he came outside when i started shouting, took me to his office and he promised he will work on my request even tho it was not his work ), Mrs Victoria ( God bless you ma , she is not just a customer care rep she is a human and a mother ) , Dr Emeka( ‘he is light skinned almost albino’ even tho he was on night shift he stayed to attend to cause of how I was feeling), Dr David ( she was very very gentle and loving I did not catch her first name, she attended to me downstairs, beautiful ,dark and short lady).
Least I forget to the doctor that took my thyroid scan thank you and the male nurse in the ER the night I came ( he suggested they start me up on something, before the doctor decided to do anything, he just kept on asking me questions and I was in pain and he did not administer anything)
Omo you people made me cry and that stupid nurse in cardio may God not bless the works of your hand , you were telling I was not patience enough, after seeing 7 doctor did all the test and the only thing you guys were giving was pcm iv upon admitting , if it was your mother or your father i hope you tell them they are not patient enough, mark my words your own too is coming . She even walked out on my husband while he was talking to her .

The Limi Hospital,1,Damilola Ipinmisho,"My Family's Agonizing experience in Limi hospital.
On 30th March, 2024, I visited Limi hospital with my family, myself, my wife, and three children. We entered the premises at about 7:50pm to the front desk to open our cards to see a doctor. Within minutes we were cleared off to see a doctor and it took about 45 minutes to get to our turn even though there were just about 4 people before us, but there were just three doctors on duty.
It got to our turn and we all got in. She asked for our card numbers and attended to us listening actively to all we narrated. She checked our temperatures and my 4 year old daughter's own read above 39 degrees Celsius; mine was about 38.5°c while the other children had about 36°c.
She finished with us and referred us to get a Diclofenac suppository inserted in her bum because the temperature was too high for a child. I got to the pharmacy and was given the suppository which was administered to her. We were referred to get clearance for our blood test and we did. The test was said to take 30 minutes after clearance, but we waited, I slept, woke and it was over 45 minutes waiting for a 30 minutes test. Alas the result was out, but no one cared to ask if your result is ready or not.
We visited the doctor for the review, and she said that there was malaria present in all the tests and then referred us to the pharmacist to get our medications.
Here the devils showed up. A bunch of humans called medical professionals with no iota on empathy for the sick. We got to their desk at about 10:30pm and we waited for a long time for drugs to be administered; they claimed to be awaiting clearance from my HMO. I asked them if I could sign off and if the clearance isn't gotten I'll pay for it. They kept mute. At about 11:30pm, I called my wife to get the kids so we returned home, no one was bothered a bit. I got to the car, called the HMO (AXA MANSARD) explained by experience to the customer personnel and told him I've been with three sick kids, eldest being 4 in the hospital for 4 hours. My son had blood mixed with his mucor, my daughter with a high temperature and I needed to pay myself if the clearance wasn't sorted.
Then, he said that there was no clearance sent to MANSARD. I was mad; to know that we had wasted well over 1hr, and a careless pharmacist didn't care to check if the messages she sent were delivered. I returned to her to let her know that she didn't send any clearance, and she said ""let me refresh"". Refresh is what you're just doing right now. So you send a message and don't get feedback for 4, and you don't think you should've refreshed after 1hour?
It's sad that I'm calling out the same Limi again who almost killed one of my twins 4 years ago when they ran a rapid malaria test and said that she had slight malaria, when a week later when her temperature spiked and was rushed to another hospital where they said she had +++ malaria.
Why's Limi so nonchalant about human lives? And the useless MANSARD staff had to tell me that if I use my money to pay, it'll take a long paper work to refund me back. I couldn't get drugs, I could pay for it.
Why do you collect HMO money if you care less about them?
This time I'll let the world know about the death trap you run as hospital.

Recently things started changing in terms of long wait times, getting test results late, 1 or 2 doctors availble to cater to loads of patients etc. I chose not to come online to say anything but something happened this week and I won't keep quiet about it.

My mum has been seeing the Physiotherapist at Limi hospital because she's been having serious lower back pain, the Orthopedic doctor at Limi hospital referred her.

Her follow-up appointment was booked for Wednesday, 18th October 2023 by 4pm, we got there to hear another story.

A frontdesk staff said the person who booked her appointment made a mistake by booking her to see a Gynecologist like really?

My mum has never seen a Gynecologist at Limi hospital so I wonder how that happened.

This appointment was physically booked at the Physiotherapy unit of the hospital not even via phone call.

Instead of them to find a way and make sure my mum sees the Physiotherapist on that same Wednesday because of the pains she was going through and the fact that it's their fault, they did nothing.

They apologized and begged us to come back next week Wednesday, 25th October 2023 that there's no slot anymore.

So they expected her to be like that till then, just imagine.

A staff reached out to the Assistant Customer Experience Officer that day about the issue, her response was ""there's nothing we can do just apologize to them and reschedule"".

I guess the person didn't know it was my mum in question because I was not facing them.

I had to leave Limi hospital and go to another hospital that same day so my mum could see a Physiotherapist, I am so disappointed and will never go back there for treatment.

The possibility of seeing the same doctor on your next visit is zero. And To see a doctor takes literally 2hours and another 1hour for test, review and pharmacy.

CardioCare Multispecialty Hospital (Limi Group),1,awesome baby,"I wish it was possible to give a lesser star than zero. I'm not sure the organisation is aware of the atrocities committed by their front desk staff. Unbelievable! I was referred from another private hospital to carry out a holter monitor test. When I got there to my surprise, the front desk staff said they don't do 48 hours only 24 hours concurrently and this would incur charges of over 40k. The staff in charge of the proceedure told me otherwise so I decided to do only 24 hours. Result was supposed to be ready in 2 working days, and in my ill health I kept going to this hospital, every time I went, they would either ignore me or act confused as to why I was there. The front desk staff were always giving wrong or conflicting information especially the one called Solomon, unnecessarily rude and very sluggish. My doctor had to call their boss that his patient's result was having issues before they managed to call me to confirm it was ready and I shouldn't bother to come as they will send it via email. I waited for 2 days and went in person. I spent over 2 hours waiting for them to print this result for me. Took the results to my doctor and he was livid, it wasn't properly done and they hurriedly wrote rubbish as result for me(10 working days after the procedure). And they tried to force me to do an ECG claiming the results needed the ECG for clearer reading lol.

They're very unprofessional and I honestly will never have anything to do with the facility. Even if I know someone considering going there I will warn against it. It's only clean and appealing to the eyes but the service is rubbish.",Garki,"{'lat': 9.0450541, 'lng': 7.5031476999999995}",Hospital,Abuja,8 months ago,,NEGATIVE,0.9988844990730286,Less than a year ago

The pharmacist above were very helpful and took their time to get an understanding your symptoms before prescribing and OTC drug. Pricing was fairly okay.

After taking the drug I came down to exit the building. I tried to leave from the door I came in but I was told that was just the entrance but another door just adjacent was an exit.

They have amble parking space although not so big but just enough for the traffic they get daily. And there are security guards willing to guide your parking and exit.

Bakan Gizo Pharmacy & Stores (Gwarinpa),1,Lorraine Watkins,Very disappointed with the customer service I received today at this store. I always come here because they tend to stock a lot of my comfort foods from the uk here. But after today I will not come back here. I purchased coco pops ( cereal ) from the store yesterday . And opened it today for breakfast to my surprise their was a small hole in the bag. I ignored that because after all this is Nigeria. I then poured the cereal into my bowl and added milk. Has I bite into it I could taste that this cereal was stale and had a taste that I’m not use to. So I decided that I would go back to the store because that’s where I brought it from. I spoke to the supervisor who doesn’t have a clue what she’s doing and doesn’t even know how to deliver effective customer service. When I explained to her what had happened. She responded back with “I should of choose a cereal that I know well. And she added that  customers can’t open products and not have grievances over it .  Firstly coco pops is a known nationwide. Hence why I knew what I was buying second of all it had a pound sterling symbol on the packaging so I definitely knew what I was choosing. To be told i could not  exchange my cereal after not being happy with it was highly frustrating because I brought it from that store. The supervisor should learn how to deal with customers who are not local like herself. Because her behaviour and attitude is not of a supervisor.,Gwarinpa Estate,"{'lat': 9.0891015, 'lng': 7.4127268}",Pharmacy,Abuja,2 years ago,,NEGATIVE,0.9946824908256531,2 years ago

Just be very vigilant when you go there ..
They will dish you food in a takeout pack and pretend to put it in a microwave to heat it up, then they will ask you to go and pay then come back and take the food..
please don’t agree oooo.. don’t step an inch.. once you go to make payment, they will immediately reduce the food they dished for you, remove the orishirishi inside the food.
When you come back after payment, they’ve already tired your food in a lylon and hand it over to you..
once you get home to eat your food, you will find out that the quantity of the food you bought has reduced drastically and some fish and meat are missing.

I was a victim of their scam and theft..
I came back few days later and comforted the salesgirl thief that did that to me.. she just rolled her eyes and never apologized…

Also always check your receipts after buying things from them..because they will intentionally add items you didn’t buy and you will end up paying for something you never bought..
They fill Abuja people are are big men/women who don’t have time to check their receipts.

Trust Charitos Hospital,1,N N (Neh_Naya),"My experience at this hospital was very bad.
There is a particular nurse; chubby, always wears turban/headgear.
On the three occasions I went to get my vaccine there, she was very rude and dismissive.
She picked offense to me wanting to see the name on the vial of the vaccine I was about to take.
Not to mention the harsh way to which she spoke and gestured towards me.
The first time this happened, I told myself most likely she’s having a bad day, but for it to happen 3 times on different occasions?Definitely not a coincidence.
It is clear some kind of training needs to be held, so that she’s aware of the full job description of a nurse.

I will definitely not be coming to this hospital again for anything.

Trust Charitos Hospital,1,Mirabel Turner,"First time visiting this hospital, In the event of an emergency make sure to avoid this hospital at all cost. Everybody walks around beautifully dressed with no sense of urgency. I cried out of frustration with how sick I was feeling and the lack of care I was receiving after paying 10,000 for registration but I was instead told “sorry but it doesn’t mean you should cry”. It was truly a very bitter experience, being very sick and uneasy I had to leave the hospital after going to the lab and still experiencing same non chalant attitude.

People may Have had great experiences but not me. Not me. Maybe initially yea. But not today. Front desk and Doctors were super nice but the lady at the pharmacy and the HMO point person were just the most unprofessional.
1. Changing the prescription of the doctor without her consent and not even according me the professional explanation to why.
2. Telling me they have other clients to attend to whose situation were presumed high priority than mine in my deteriorating state.
3. Laughing behind my back and calling me ignorant like I was mad. After making me wait for house.
4. Watch me leave in anger and. Poor health and did nothing to change the situation.
I know of people who have lost family members there but I still choose them thinking they will never neglect patients. When I first started with them the priority they placed on me was top notch but I can now clearly see. How they neglect people and doctors directives.

The gentleman you have in your HMO office (who uses glasses and his name starts with ""K"") needs to be trained (not fired please) on Customer Service and Customer Experience. From my experience, he doesn't care so much about the well being of the  customer. It's not just about sitting behind the computer and submitting documents. Empathy, Care and Compassion are crucial when it comes to a health care center like yours. He needs to be interested in solving the problem.

The admission rooms are surprisingly cozy and neat, rivaling those of a hotel! If not for the medical equipment, you could easily mistake it for a comfortable vacation room.

The doctors too take time to explain and it seems they understand the calm and peace that comes from speaking with someone of the same ‘tongue’. They encourage patients sharing experiences as it boosts morale especially when you have to get a procedure done.

The room, cleanliness, food, toilet, care package you receive when admitted are all thoughtfully put together. The dietician even came to attend to our dietary needs. It was worth every cent.

Nizamiye Hospital,1,Ge Ge,"My baby got fever and infection so we sent him to this hospital, the doctor arranged the baby to stay in the hospital. we stayed in the hospital for five days. It costs more than 1 million naira. money is ok if the patient get recovery, however, the baby just no fever again, but still diarrhea.  Within these five days , the doctor just come to see the baby one time per day and stayed few minutes. The hospital charged this few minutes 21250 one time.
That's really unreasonable, we went to see the doctor in his office , we need to pay 21250 , under his treatment , it didn't work well he went to see the baby in ward, we have to pay 21250 again. This is not a hospital, this is a robber. Before leaving the hospital, i asked some doctors and nurses in the hospital , all of them said this fee no need to pay. but the cashier said we need to pay first because we need to discharge , and come to the hospital next day, they will refund to us. when we go to the hospital next day, the cashier office refused to refund and said the doctor come to see the patient many times, so they have to charge one time. that's really ridiculous, because the doctor just come one time per day and even their own doctors and nurses said this fee we should not pay. I don't know why how a cashier have to charge this. however, what can we do when they refuse to refund. Is there any organization that manages these hospitals?

Inexperienced doctors and nurses kept in emergency period who don't have the least humanity and ample knowledge on how to treat a severe patient. If a patient enters the ward in pain the doctors need to treat them but the system in this hospital says: finish the payment and wait for the nurse... if that's the case then whats the difference between emergency and general ward?? Attending nurse's behavior was so arrogant which I've never seen before because they are supposed to treat you with care. When inserting the IV canola in my hand, I felt pain and complained but she arrogantly answered saying ""I know my job"" and proceeded to give me more pain.... after my birth this is the first time i cried at a hospital. I would like to request the management of this hospital to deploy admins during the night shift as well so the staff can at least act professional instead of behaving like immature people. I also expect serious action against said nurse that attended me tonight, if this isn't done then I will raise my voice even more because today's experience was the worst.",Life Camp,"{'lat': 9.0594898, 'lng': 7.3907354}",Hospital,Abuja,3 years ago,,NEGATIVE,0.9905999302864075,3 years ago

Nizamiye Hospital,3,Onyi,"I don’t trust the Doctors and their assistants at this facility. It is overhyped because it is a Turkish owned hospital. I met with a dental specialist today and had to pay N5k for registration and N10k for the initial consultation. I tried explaining my x-ray chart to him and he acted like he didn’t want to listen to what I had to say. Once he was done looking at it, he then tried to listen to me. I explained to him that my lower wisdom teeth had to be extracted and the upper one will be left to grow out before extraction, so as to avoid breaking the bone around the teeth which will lead to severe injury as described by my Dentist in the U.S. But he wanted to extract all the wisdom teeth but at different time interval instead of just the lower ones at different times. I feel like all they want is money and the so called v.i.p patients get better care than regular patients. Additionally, if we are paying high amounts for your service, I believe you should have free WiFi just like the high-end hospitals overseas. Also, please have a meeting and reevaluate the method of customer service that is exhibited by both the doctors and other employees. Besides trying to treat patients problems, also make an effort to listen to them. You might be a medical professional, but the patient knows themselves better than you do, so listening won’t be bad. I just felt so insulted, in the U.S.A my Doctors are always eager to hear what I have to say as I am to them.  No need for any arrogant attitude because you feel your Turkish & better than Nigerian doctors and citizens, I find it low key racist.",Life Camp,"{'lat': 9.0594898, 'lng': 7.3907354}",Hospital,Abuja,3 years ago,,NEGATIVE,0.9992451667785645,3 years ago

Nizamiye Hospital,1,Emeni Chim,"This is my most horrible experience since going to Hospitals in Nigeria, I was at this hospital on Monday 27th, directed to see Dr Akif (Consultation fee is 7,500) who  prescribed tests for me. I paid for the tests + their checkup which cost N70,000 . After this , the Doctor said he can't see malaria in my results, that my tests shows am fine but he would give me malaria drugs since am showing signs, I alerted him to the Salmonella typhi that states positive but he said it was insignificant, this was confusing but I decided to let him do his job. I paid 10,000 for ibruprofen, antibiotics and coartem. 3 days later was still sick without any improvement mostly at night. I came back to complain to the doctor and he wrote another test now 18,000. I complained that I have done these same tests on Monday and it's just unreasonable that I am asked to pay for it again . The Manager rudely insisted it is their policy, the doctor was angry because I kept reminding him that he neglected the Typhoid symptoms and the test results.
I left the hospital Knowing I have to go to another hospital to start all over again. I blame myself for coming here , most times we neglect our own doctors in Nigeria who understand the disease we commonly have here like typhoid and malaria and in the name of top class we fall victim to these hospitals.

Abiodun Falade Hospitals Abuja,5,Nelly Ogochukwu Daniel,"I recently underwent surgery at Abiodun Falade Hospital Abuja, and I must say I was very impressed with the quality of care I received. The staff were all attentive and caring, and the doctors were knowledgeable and reassuring. The hospital itself was very clean, with cleaners coming around to clean twice a day which made me feel comfortable during my stay.

I was also very pleased with the speed of my recovery after the surgery. I experienced a rapid recovery. As of 24 hours post-surgery, I was able to walk downstairs without support and even walked around the hospital to stretch my legs.

The doctors and nurses provided excellent post-surgery care which helped me heal very fast.

Thanks to Dr. Gloria for providing me with emotional support the very first day I visited the hospital for consultation because I was really scared of surgery.

My biggest fear was having scars after the surgery, but to my surprise I have no visible scar, just a thin line that is hardly noticeable.

Honestly, I was extremely satisfied with my experience at Abiodun Falade Hospital and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone in need of medical care, especially Myomectomy.

I had the surgery and to God be the glory, it was very successful, the doctors and nurses were very friendly and understanding, even in the theater, they held me like their own.
They helped me through the process, I was never alone.
There was 24hrs check up from them every now and then.
The consultant and the main doctor were the nicest doctors I have come across.
I even noticed the way they treat their staff, they are like one big family and I must say, thank God for leading me to this particular hospital.

Maitama District Hospital,1,Enikanonaiye Samuel,"Greatness Olorunfemi, a young lady in Abuja, fell victim to 'one-chance' criminals and tragically lost her life after a hospital allegedly turned her away. The incident occurred in the Maitama area of Abuja. According to a Twitter user named #Gbemilekhe, who shared the story, the hospital demanded a police report before providing any treatment. This delay proved fatal, as Greatness passed away shortly after. Another user identified as #Nwaadaz, claiming to be a friend of Olorunfemi, provided additional details, stating that the assailants had stabbed her. Unfortunately, the hospital's refusal to treat her led to her bleeding to death. This user expressed outrage at the situation, condemning the hospital's actions and lamenting the broader societal failure. The incident highlights a distressing reality of inadequate emergency care and the need for urgent reforms in the healthcare system, particularly in cases of trauma where immediate attention can make a critical difference between life and death. Greatness' tragic demise serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by victims of such crimes and the importance of timely and accessible medical assistance.

A couple of good doctors.
They outshine other hospitals with their feeding arrangement which makes so much sense since patients don’t have to bother about meals from outside.
However, the hospital services makes it worse than a public hospital:
1. Very unprofessional staff. The attendants(especially at the lab) will beg you for money while you’re there.
They will give you a paper and will send patients on errands all over the hospital despite having an intercom.
2. There’s a young lady called Dr. Aisha, she’s the most impolite and disrespectful medical doctor I’ve ever seen.

I requested if he could atleast give some Intra muscular injections start so we could continue...he refused saying the drugs he is prescribing does not have IM alternative...all with attitude. In summary , the prescription was grossly inadequate...even the nurse that gave injection was surprised the doctor didn't see the child was dehydrated and no ORS was prescribed she wanted to take us back to the doctor but we have had enough ...the pharmacist had to go back to him to change the antimalarial drug cos the child just finished the same drugs 2weeks ago but still had 2+ of mp which I told the attending doctor during consultation.  I left the hospital and stopped at a pharmacy to buy the appropriate drugs....this is my first time of using Zankli and I was dissappointed , people like Dr. Okafor are the people that give hospitals and the profession bad name.

King's Care Hospital,2,Ademola Okunaiya,"Kings Care Kubwa is now a shadow of itself. Mist of the experienced hands are gone. Apart from a few older nurses, what you have are young inexperienced nurses with killer or no supervision.

The nurses are also very poor at communicating and responding to inquiries. Because of their attitude my son had to stay an extra night in hospital because due to their lack of communication we did not know we had to transit from antibiotic injection to oral therefore breaking the treatment chain. The non medical staff can also be quite saucy. They still have a few good doctors but the establishment as a whole is no more what it used to be.

She asked for my card and I said i didn't have one, then she asked what I wanted her to do for me, instead of telling me the procedure.
I asked her how much it cost and she looked at me, laughing in a disgusting manner like I could not afford it. I confronted her and she was being sarcastic.

King's Care Hospital,1,Rhodescea Mine,"I was given 2 tablets of palurdrine(Malaria drug) daily from 8 Weeks of my pregnancy. The heartbeat later stopped at three months plus which I discovered in another hospital.I was attended to by doctor Patrick who said an evacuation Will be done. He collected side payment of 25k from us on the 10th of November 2018 and refused us from paying to the cashier. Another doctor who is very tall called Doctor Uzodinma did the evacuation and did it incomplete. I went to Zenith for a scan and I was told that there is remnant. We went back to kings care but doctor Patrick Asked us to go get some drugs including antibiotics and metropostol that it will flush out the remnant. We waited till the next day, remnants didn't come out. I went back at 12pm to complain but he said I should wait till the next day that the doctor who is meant to redo the evacuation is not around and that we have to buy blood the next  day. He was rude and was even walking  us out of his office with my life at stake. I decided not to continue there I called someone else who quickly reached out to unity hospital and the doctor scanned and discovered that the placenta was not removed and that alone can kill a woman in a very short time. This was how I left kingscare to do the second  evacuation in Unity. The so-called black huge Doctor Patrick just ate our money.The painful part was that him and the doctor who did the evacuation the first time  didn't even give me antibiotics to take. He used an old letter headed paper to write for us to go and buy drugs which is different from the one the hospital is currently using just so that he won't be held accountable for damages. Kingscare killed my baby with the malaria medicine and they almost took my life with their carelessness.The hospital is a no no, my enemy won't go there. Kingscare is not recommendable.

Dr. Folake, the gynecologist I consulted, was thorough, patient, attentive and a vibe might I add (any nervousness or anxiety I had about my results were gone). She listened carefully to my concerns and provided clear explanations, which made me feel reassured and well-cared for.

I would also like to make an honorable mention of the two male doctors I interacted with in the scan room, the nurse who took my vitals and the front desk Lady that switched with Grace.

Kelina Hospital Abuja,1,Emperor BOB,"Going to this hospital for first childbirth is like pouring sand in the sea. They will drain you.

First off, even if you’ve done antinatal therapy elsewhere, they will still force you to pay for it even if you just have a day or 2 to delivery.  And it’s over 250k. All in the name of we want to understand your body.  Mind you, you’ll also pay for unnecessary test that you’ve already done before.

After that the gynecologist will forcefully want to examine your wife or woman’s’ body (vagina) mind you, this procedure is done with an aggressive manner.

After that he will tell you all sort of gibberish and tell you boldly that the only way he can deliver your child is through CS (operating). All these is just to suck money out of you. Imagine a doctor that you paid money to confidently telling you that the only way he can have your child is through operation.

To sum it all up this hospital is all about money, forget packaging na Nigeria we dey.

Anyways I had my baby elsewhere. And she was delivered the proper way. And the mother too is in perfect condition. IF you follow these so called gynecologists mouth you fit go do wetin go land your woman for eternal problem.

It was crazy and I still can’t believe that the hospital I rated highly could be that callous and irresponsible with lives.
