"DAUGHTERS OF CHARITY OF ST VINCENT DE PAUL HOSPITAL, FO1, KUBWA - ABUJA",1,,"I had a terrible experience, went in very sick wanted to see the doctor, the whole procedure before seeing the doctor was something else.

After going through the stress of finally seeing the doctor, the doctor recommended I do test and scan as well.
After doing the test the lab said my result will be ready by 4pm. Meanwhile I was there around 10am. For someone that is very sick you are saying I should  wait till 4pm to collect result before seeing the doctor for medication.

The worst part was when I went for scanning after waiting for my turn that was how I wasn’t attended to and they were not attending  to any patient when I confronted them the person in charge said he was busy typing , how can you be typing when I have waited over one hour just to do scan and patients are waiting that was how he started yelling at us that we cannot teach him how to do his job moreover he is supposed to be at home.

I honestly have a lot to say but I hope the management gets to see this and I think they need to inculcate and teach the staff the act of empathy, because empathy is one of the core values of the hospital and they have zero empathy.",Kubwa,"{'lat': 9.1618518, 'lng': 7.3575308}",Hospital,Dushepe,10 months ago,,NEGATIVE,0.997998297,Less than a year ago,NEGATIVE,NEGATIVE

King's Care Hospital,1,Rhodescea Mine,"I was given 2 tablets of palurdrine(Malaria drug) daily from 8 Weeks of my pregnancy. The heartbeat later stopped at three months plus which I discovered in another hospital.I was attended to by doctor Patrick who said an evacuation Will be done. He collected side payment of 25k from us on the 10th of November 2018 and refused us from paying to the cashier. Another doctor who is very tall called Doctor Uzodinma did the evacuation and did it incomplete. I went to Zenith for a scan and I was told that there is remnant. We went back to kings care but doctor Patrick Asked us to go get some drugs including antibiotics and metropostol that it will flush out the remnant. We waited till the next day, remnants didn't come out. I went back at 12pm to complain but he said I should wait till the next day that the doctor who is meant to redo the evacuation is not around and that we have to buy blood the next  day. He was rude and was even walking  us out of his office with my life at stake. I decided not to continue there I called someone else who quickly reached out to unity hospital and the doctor scanned and discovered that the placenta was not removed and that alone can kill a woman in a very short time. This was how I left kingscare to do the second  evacuation in Unity. The so-called black huge Doctor Patrick just ate our money.The painful part was that him and the doctor who did the evacuation the first time  didn't even give me antibiotics to take. He used an old letter headed paper to write for us to go and buy drugs which is different from the one the hospital is currently using just so that he won't be held accountable for damages. Kingscare killed my baby with the malaria medicine and they almost took my life with their carelessness.The hospital is a no no, my enemy won't go there. Kingscare is not recommendable.

Drs Nadosa and Undie were excellent . I thank them immensely . I advise the government to give hospitals and clinics like kelina grant for them to continue to save lives and do what they know best . The country will save a lot in foreign exchange through drastic reduction in medical tourism .

Let me start from the not so good.
Accessibility; very poor. The roads leading to the facility are a nightmare, they may however transform to very good when ongoing road construction in the area is completed.
Pricey? Yes it is, very pricey but not as pricey as flying abroad.
Quality of service and Professionalism? Excellent. They are attentive, diligent, thorough, and always on time. The hospital is one of the cleanest places I've visited.

After much back and forth with the lab technician, I agreed to another sample collection, which surprisingly came out really in less than 5 minutes.

The next phase was to meet with a doctor to review the test. I have been here for over four hours(including the time of back and forth with the lab), and all I keep hearing is, the doctor will see you soon.

I was ready to pay extra half a million for 3 days just for recovery but that would not include the nurses taking care of her. We needed to pay extra.
